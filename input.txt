A hundred years ago

there were one and a half billion people on Earth.

Now, over six billion crowd our fragile planet.

But even so, there are still places barely touched by humanity.

This series will take to the last wildernesses

and show you the planet and its wildlife

as you have never seen them before.

Imagine our world without sun.

Male Emperor Penguins are facing the nearest that exists on planet Earth -

winter in Antarctica.

It's continuously dark

and temperatures drop to minus seventy degrees centigrade.

The penguins stay when all other creatures have fled

because each guards a treasure:

A single egg rested on the top of its feet

and kept warm beneath the downy bulge of its stomach.

There is no food and no water for them,

and they will not see the sun again for four months.

Surely no greater ordeal is faced by any animal.

As the sun departs from the Antarctic

it lightens the skies in the far north.

It's March

and light returns to the high Arctic,

sweeping away four months of darkness.

A polar bear stirs.

She has been in her den the whole winter.

Her emergence marks the beginning of spring.

After months of confinement underground

she toboggans down the slope.

Perhaps to clean her fur,

perhaps for sheer joy.

Her cubs gaze out of their bright new world

for the very first time.

The female calls them,

but this steep slope is not the easiest place to take your first steps.

But they are hungry

and eager to reach their mother,

who's delayed feeding them on this special day.

Now she lures them with the promise of milk,

the only food the cubs have known since they were born

deaf and blind beneath the snow some two months ago.

Their mother has not eaten for five months

and has lost half her body weight.

Now she converts the last of her fat reserves into milk for her cubs.

The spring sun brings warmth

but also a problem for the mother.

It starts to melt the sea ice.

That is where she hunts for the seal she needs to feed her cubs.

And she must get there before the ice breaks up.

For now though it's still minus thirty degrees

and the cubs must have the shelter of the den.

It's six days since the bears emerged

and spring is advancing rapidly.

But even now blizzards can strike without warning.

Being so small,

the cubs are easily chilled and they will be more comfortable resting in the den.

But their mother must keep them out and active.

She's becoming weak from hunger

and there's no food on these nursery slopes.

The sea ice still holds firm,

but it won't last much longer.

Day 10,

and the mother has led her cubs a mile from the den.

It's time to put them to the test.

They've grown enormously in confidence,

but they don't have their mother's sense of urgency.

At last it seems that they're ready for their journey

and they're only just in time,

for a few miles from the coast the ice is already splitting.

Now the mother can start hunting for the seals they must have,

but she's leading her cubs into a dangerous new world.

Nearly half of all cubs die in their first year out on the ice.

Summer brings 24 hours of sunlight

and the thawing shifting landscape.

Further south the winter snows have almost cleared from the Arctic tundra.

Northern Canada's wild frontier.

Here nature stages one of her greatest dramas -

Every year three million caribou migrate across the Arctic tundra.

The immensity of the herd can only be properly appreciated from the air.

Some herds travel over 2,000 miles a year in search of fresh pastures.

This is the longest overland migration made by any animal.

They're constantly on the move.

Newborn calves have to be up and running the day they are born.

But the vast herds do not travel alone.

Wolves.

Packs of them, eight to ten strong, shadow the migration.

And they are hungry.

It's the newly born calves that they are after.

Running directly at the herd is a ploy to generate panic.

The herd breaks up

and now it's easier to target an individual.

In the chaos a calf is separated from its mother.

The calf is young,

but it can outrun the wolf if only it manages to keep its footing.

At this stage the odds are even -

either the caribou will make a mistake

or after a mile the wolf will give up.

Midsummer on the tundra

and the sun does not set.

At these latitudes the sun's rays are glancing

and not enough of their energy reaches the ground

to enable trees to grow.

You'll need to travel 500 miles south from here

before that is possible.

These stunted shrubs mark the tree line -

the beginning of the boreal forest -

the taiga.

The needle-shaped leaves of the conifers are virtually inedible

so this forest supports very little animal life.

It's a silent place

where the snow is unmarked by footprints.

In the Arctic winter

snow forms a continuous blanket across the land.

But as spring creeps up from the south

the taiga is unveiled.

This vast forest circling the globe

contains a third of all the trees on Earth

and produces so much oxygen

it changes the composition of the atmosphere.

As we travel south

so the sun's influence grows stronger

and at 50 degrees of latitude a radical transformation begins.

Summers here are long enough for broadleaf trees to replace conifers.

Broadleaves are much easier to eat and digest

so now animals can collect their share of the energy

that has come from the sun.

It's summer

and these forests are bustling with life.

But the good times will not last.

Broad leaves must be shed in winter for their damage by frost.

As they disappear,

so the land becomes barren with little for animals to eat.

The inhabitants must migrate,

hibernate,

or face months of near starvation.

The Amur leopard -

the rarest cat in the world.

Here, in the deciduous forests of eastern Russia

the winter makes hunting very difficult.

Pray animals are scarce,

and there's no concealing vegetation.

The cub is a year old and still dependent on its mother.

Deer are frequent casualties of the harsh winter

and these leopards are not above scavenging from a corpse.

African leopards could never survive here,

but the Russian cats have thick fur to shield them from the cold.

There are only forty Amur leopards left in the wild

and that number is falling.

Like so many creatures,

the cats have been pushed to the very edge of extinction

by hunting and the destruction of their habitat.

The Amur leopard symbolizes the fragility of our natural heritage.

The future of an entire species hangs on survival

of a tiny number of mothers like this one.

All animals, rare or common,

ultimately depend for their energy on the sun.

In Japan the arrival of the cherry blossom

announces the beginning of spring.

The sun's energy brings color to the landscape.

The earth, as it makes its annual journey around the sun,

spins on a tilted axis.

And it's this tilt that creates the seasons.

The advance of the seasons brings constant change.

As the sun's influence diminishes in the north,

so the deciduous forests of America begin to shut down

losing their leaves in preparation for the dark cold months ahead.

One season hands over to another.

Some organisms thrive on decay,

but most must make special preparations for winter

and a life with little sun.

Whole populations of animals

are now forced to travel great distances in pursuit of food and warmth.

300,000 Baikal teal gather to escape from the Siberian winter

by migrating south to Korea -

the world's entire population in a single flock.

But there are parts of the world that have no seasons.

In the tropics the sun's rays strike the earth head on

and their strength is more or less constant all year round.

That is why the jungle grows so vigorously

and supports so much life.

This forest covers only 3 percent of the planet's surface,

but it contains more than 50 percent of all its plants and animals.

The canopy is particularly rich.

There are monkeys, birds

and millions of species of insects,

exactly how many we have no idea.

The character of the forest changes as we descend,

becoming ever darker and damper,

favoring different kinds of animals and plants.

Less than 2 percent of the sunlight reaches the floor,

but even here there is extraordinary variety.

In the great island of New Guinea

there are 42 different species of birds of paradise,

each more bizarre than the last.

This forest is so rich

that nourishing food can be gathered very quickly.

That leaves the male six-plumed bird of paradise

with time to concentrate on other matters

like tidying up his display area.

Everything must be spick and span.

All is ready.

Very impressive,

but no one is watching.

The superb bird of paradise calls to attract a female.

And he has more luck.

But what does he have to do to really impress her?

She retires to consider her verdict.

It's hard not to feel deflated

when even your best isn't good enough.

The sun influences life in the oceans just as it does on land.

Its richest parts are those where waves and currents

bring fertilizing nutrients to surface waters

that are bathed in sunlight.

The seas off the Cape in South Africa have this magic recipe

and are hugely productive.

Summer is the time of plenty

and it's now that the seals start to breed.

The strike of a great white shark lasts a mere second.

Slowing it down forty times reveals the technique

and immense strength of this massive predator.

If surprise fails,

there will be a chase.

The shark is faster on a straight course

but it can't turn as sharply as the seal,

its agility versus power.

Once the seals have finished breeding

the giant sharks will move on.

It's now becoming clear

that great whites migrate thousands of miles across the oceans

to harvest seasonal abundances in different seas.

The sun, beating down on tropical waters,

powers the weather systems of the globe.

Moisture evaporates from the warming ocean

and rises to create great storms.

The winds generated out at sea

sweep inland across the continents.

As they travel across the Sahara

they create the biggest of all sand storms

blowing sand halfway round the world

to fertilize the Amazon jungle.

Winds blowing across the Indian Ocean

collect moisture and sweep northwards towards the Himalayas.

As the air rises, so it cools.

The water it carries

condenses into clouds

and then falls as the life giving rains of the monsoon.

So air currents powered by the sun

carry wet air to the middle of continents.

Without water

there can be no life,

but its distribution over the land is far from even.

Deserts cover one third of the land's surface

and they're growing bigger every year.

This is the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa.

It's the dry season

and thousands of elephants have started to travel

in desperate search for water.

All across Southern Africa animals are journeying for the same reason.

Buffalo join the great trek.

Nowhere else on Earth are so many animals on the move

with the same urgent purpose.

They're all heading for the swamps of the Okavango,

a vast inland delta.

At the moment it is dry,

but water is coming.

The travelers are hampered by dangerous dust storms.

Females and calves can easily get separated from the main herd.

For this pair sanctuary lies in the patch of woodland a few miles ahead.

They can't rest until they reach it.

The main has already got there safely.

Finally, the stragglers emerge from the dust.

The exhausted calf is still blinded by sand.

Its mother does everything possible to help it.

The storm is now subsiding,

but not all the elephants have been so lucky.

One youngster has got lost.

Thirsty and exhausted,

it follows the tracks of its mother,

but sadly in the wrong direction.

At the peak of the dry season in the Kalahari

water arrives in the Okavango.

It fell as rain a thousand miles away in the highlands of Angola

and has taken nearly five months to reach here.

The water drives out insects from the parched ground,

which are snapped up by plovers.

Catfish, traveling with the flood,

collect any drowning creatures the birds have missed.

It's a seasonal feast for animals of all kinds.

Birds are the first to arrive in any numbers -

wattled cranes,

then black storks.

Behind the birds come buffalo.

After weeks of marching their trek is coming to an end.

As the water sweeps into the Okavango

a vast area of the Kalahari is transformed into a fertile paradise.

Nowhere on our planet is the life giving power of water so clearly demonstrated.

The Okavango becomes criss-crossed with trails

as animals move into its heart.

The new arrivals open up paths like arteries

along which water flows,

extending the reach of the flood.

This is an Africa rarely seen -

a lush water world.

Some creatures are completely at home here.

These are lechwe -

antelope with hooves that splay widely,

enabling them to move its speed through the water.

For others the change is far less welcome.

Baboons are somewhat apprehensive bathers.

The water brings a season of plenty for all animals.

Hunting dogs.

These are now among the rarest of Africa's mammals,

but then nonetheless the continent's most efficient predators.

Their secret is teamwork.

Impala are their favorite prey.

They start to hunt

and the pack splits up.

An aerial viewpoint gives a new insight into their strategy.

As the dogs approach their prey

they peel off to take up separate positions around their target.

They seem to form a cordon around the impala.

Moving in total silence

they take up their positions.

Those ears can detect the slightest rustle.

The hunt is on.

Three dogs close in on one impala.

Missed.

The lead dog drives the impala towards the hidden flankers.

Anticipating their line

the leader cuts the corner

and joins a flanker for the final assault.

It's all or nothing.

One on one.

The dog has stamina,

the impala has speed.

Leaping into the lake is an act of desperation -

impala can barely swim.

The dogs know their prey must come out or drown -

now it's a waiting game.

The rest of the pack are calling.

They've made a kill in the forest

and this is an invitation to join in the meal.

The impala is in luck.

A pack this size kills once a day and everything is shared.

And this impala is reprieved.

The elephants are nearing the end of their long journey.

After weeks of marching they're desperately tired.

The matriarch can smell water

and encourages the herd to make one last effort.

The youngsters are exhausted

but their mothers have made this journey before

and they know that they're close to water.

After many hundreds of miles they've arrived.

The lives of these elephants are dominated by the annual rhythm of wet and dry,

a seasonal cycle created by the sun.

At the southern end of the earth,

after four months of total darkness,

the sun once more rises over Antarctica.

Now at last the Emperor penguins abandon their huddle.

The males are still carrying the precious eggs

that they've cherished throughout the Antarctic winter.

With the returning sun the eggs hatch.

Other birds have not even arrived.

But the Emperors by enduring the long black winter

have given their chicks a head start.

These youngsters are now ready and eager to make the most of the brief Antarctic summer.
Human beings venture into the highest parts of our planet at their peril.

Some might think that by climbing a great mountain

they have somehow conquered it,

but we can only be visitors here.

This is a frozen alien world.

This is the other extreme -

one of the lowest hottest places on Earth.

It's over a hundred meters below the level of the sea.

But here a mountain is in gestation.

Pools of sulphuric acid are indications

that deep underground there are titanic stirrings.

This is the Danakil Depression in Ethiopia,

lying within a colossal rent of the earth's surface

where giant land masses are pulling away from one another.

Lava rises to the surface through this crack in the crust

creating a chain of young volcanoes.

This one, Erta Ale,

is today the longest continually erupting volcano on the planet,

a lake of lava that has been molten for over a hundred years.

These same volcanic forces also created Ethiopia's highlands.

70 million years ago

this land was just as flat and as deep

as the Danakil Depression.

Molten lava rising from the earth's core

forced up a huge dome of rock 500 miles wide,

the roof of Africa.

Over millennia, rain and ice carved the rock

into a landscape of spires and canyons.

These summits, nearly 3 miles up,

are home to some very remarkable mountaineers -

Gelada baboons.

They are unique to the highlands of Ethiopia.

The cliffs where they sleep are for expert climbers only,

and Gelado certainly have the right equipment.

The strongest fingers of any primate

and an utterly fearless disposition.

But you need more than a head for heights to survive up here.

A day in a Gelado's life reveals how they've risen to the challenge.

For all monkeys morning is grooming time,

a chance to catch up with friends.

But, unlike other monkeys,

Gelados chatter constantly while they do it.

It's a great way to network while your hands are busy.

But these socials can't go on for too long.

Gelados have a busy daily schedule

and there's work to be done.

Most monkeys couldn't live up here.

There's no food and few insects to feed on.

But Gelados are unique -

they're the only monkeys in the world that live almost entirely on grass.

They live in the largest assemblies formed by any monkeys.

Some groups are 800 strong

and they crop the high meadows like herds of wildebeest.

The Gelados graze alongside Walia ibex,

which are also unique to these highlands.

These rare creatures are usually very shy

but they drop their guard when the Gelados are around.

You might expect that grazers would avoid each other's patch

but this is a special alliance from which both partners benefit.

It's not so risky to put your head down

if others are on the lookout.

Ethiopian wolves -

they won't attempt an attack in broad daylight.

But at dusk the plateau becomes a more dangerous place.

With the grazing largely over

there's a last chance to socialize before returning to the sleeping cliffs.

An early warning system puts everyone on the alert.

Their day ends as it began, safe on the steep cliffs.

The Ethiopian volcanoes are dormant,

but elsewhere others still rage.

Volcanoes form the backbone of the longest mountain chain on our planet -

the Andes of South America.

This vast range stretches 5,000 miles from the Equator down to the Antarctic.

It formed as the floor of the Pacific Ocean

slid beneath the South American continent, buckling its edge.

At the southern end stand the mountains of Patagonia.

It's high summer,

but the Andes have the most unstable mountain weather on the planet

and storms can erupt without warning.

Temperatures plummet

and guanacos and their newborn young must suddenly endure a blizzard.

Truly, all seasons in one day...

A puma -

the lion of the Andes.

Pumas are usually solitary and secretive.

To see a group walking boldly in the open is extremely rare.

It's a family - a mother with four cubs.

She has just one brief summer

in which to teach them their mountain survival techniques.

Rearing four cubs to this age is an exceptional feat,

but she does have an excellent territory,

rich in food and water.

Although the cubs are now as large as their mother,

they still rely on her for their food.

It will be another year before the cubs can hunt for themselves.

Without their mother's skill and experience

they would never survive their first winter.

Battered by hurricane force winds,

these slopes are now lifeless.

Further north, they hold other dangers.

Moving at 250 miles an hour,

an avalanche destroys everything in its path.

In the American Rockies

a 100,000 avalanches devastate the slopes every winter.

This huge mountain chain continues the great spine

that runs from Patagonia to Alaska.

The slopes of the Rockies, bleak though they are,

provide a winter refuge for some animals.

A mother grizzly emerges from her den

after six months' dozing underground.

Her two cubs follow her

and take their first steps in the outside world.

These steep slopes provide a sanctuary for the cubs.

A male bear would kill and eat them given the chance.

But big animals find it difficult to get about here.

Males may be twice the size of a female

and even she can have problems.

Her cubs, however, make light of the snow

and of life in general.

But the mother faces a dilemma:

It's six months since she last fed

and her milk is starting to run dry.

She must soon leave the safety of these nursery slopes

and lead her cubs away from the mountain.

If she delays, the whole family will risk starvation.

Summer reveals the true nature of the Rockies.

Stripped of snow,

the peaks bear their sculpted forms.

Only now can mountaineers reclaim the upper reaches.

Two miles up the crumbling precipices seem devoid of life.

But there are animals here -

a grizzly bear.

It seems to be an odd creature to find on these high rocky slopes.

It's hard to imagine what could have attracted it here.

At this time of the year bears should be fattening up for the winter.

Yet they gather in some numbers on these apparently barren slopes.

They're searching for a rather unusual food -

moths.

Millions have flown up here to escape the heat of the lowlands

and they're now roosting among the rocks.

Moths may seem a meager meal for a bear,

but their bodies are rich in fat

and can make all the difference in a bear's annual struggle for survival.

Another battle is being waged here

but on a much longer timescale.

These loose boulders are the mountain's crumbling bones.

The Rockies are no longer rising

but slowly disintegrating.

All mountains everywhere are being worn down by frost, snow and ice.

The Alps were raised some 15 million years ago

as Africa, drifting northwards, collided with the southern edge of Europe.

These spires are the eroded remains of an ancient seabed

that once stretched between the two continents.

But these are just the Alpine foothills.

The range at its center rises to 3 miles high

and is crowned with permanent snows.

The Matterhorn,

its summit too steep to hold a snow field.

Mont Blanc - the highest peak in Western Europe.

The distinctive jagged shapes of the Alps

were carved by those great mountain sculptors -

the glaciers.

Immense rivers of moving ice,

laden with rock,

grind their way down the mountains,

gouging out deep valleys.

They're the most powerful erosive force on our planet.

A moulin - a shaft in the ice opened by melt water

as it plunges into the depths of the glacier.

Like the water running through it,

the ice itself is constantly moving,

flowing down the valley with unstoppable force.

Alpine glaciers may seem immense,

but they're dwarfed by those in the great ranges

that divide the Indian subcontinent from Tibet.

This is the boulder strewn snout

of the giant Baltoro glacier in the Karakoram mountains of Pakistan.

It's the biggest mountain glacier on Earth -

43 miles long and over 3 miles wide.

This huge ice-filled valley is so large

it's clearly visible from space.

This is the greatest concentration of peaks over 5 miles high

to be found anywhere on Earth.

They're the most dangerous mountains of all.

K2 and her sister peaks have claimed more lives than any others.

The peaks here rise so precipitously,

the glaciers are so steep and crevassed

that few except the most skilled mountaineers can penetrate these ranges.

Markhor gather for their annual rut.

Males must fight for the right to breed,

but on these sheer cliffs any slip by either animal could be fatal.

A snow leopard -

the rarest of Himalayan animals.

It's a female returning to her lair.

These are the first intimate images of snow leopard ever filmed in the wild.

She greets her one year old cub.

Her den is well chosen.

It has exceptional views of the surrounding cliffs.

On these treacherous slopes

no hunter other than the snow leopard

would have a chance of catching such fragile prey.

A female with young makes an easier target.

Her large paws give an excellent grip

and that long tail helps her balance.

Silently she positions herself above her prey.

She returns with nothing.

Golden eagles patrol these cliffs in search of the weak or injured.

With a 2 meter wing span

this bird could easily take a young markhor.

Eagles hunt by sight

and the thickening veil of snow forces them to give up.

For the leopard the snow provides cover

and creates an opportunity.

The worsening weather dampens the sound of her approach

allowing her to get within striking distance.

It was an act of desperation

to try and catch such a large animal.

Wolves have made a kill

giving other hunters a chance to scavenge.

The worst of the blizzard brings success for the snow leopard,

but having descended so far to make the kill

she has a grueling climb to get back to her lair.

The cub must be patient.

It'll be a year before it has the strength and skill

to kill for itself on these difficult slopes.

The snow leopard is an almost mythical creature,

an icon of the wilderness,

an animal few humans have ever glimpsed

for its world is one we seldom visit.

The Karakoram lie at the western end of a range

that stretches across a tenth of our planet -

the Himalayas.

These, the highest mountains of the world,

like other great ranges,

were created by the collision of continents.

Some 50 million years ago

India collided with Tibet

thrusting up these immense peaks, which are still rising.

This vast barrier of rock and ice

is so colossal it shapes the world's climate.

Warm winds from India, full of moisture,

are forced upwards by the Himalayas.

As the air rises so it cools,

causing clouds to form

and the monsoon is born.

At high altitudes the monsoon rains fall as snow.

Here, at the far eastern end of the range in China,

one inhabitant endures the bitter winters out in the open.

Most other bears would be sleeping underground by now,

but the giant panda can't fatten up enough to hibernate.

Its food, bamboo, on which it totally relies

has so little nutritional value

that it can't build up a store of fat like other bears.

Most of the creatures here move up or down the slopes with the seasons

but the panda is held captive by its diet

for the kind of bamboo it eats only grows at this altitude.

But these forests hold fewer challenges for the more mobile.

The golden snap-nosed monkey, like the giant panda, lives only in China.

Their thick fur allows them to survive at greater altitudes than any other monkey

and when the cold bites they have these upper slopes to themselves.

Even if you have a warm coat

it apparently helps to surround yourself with as many layers as possible.

But at least these monkeys have a choice -

if they tire of tree bark and other survival food

they can always descend to lower warmer altitudes

and not return there till spring.

As the snows retreat

trees come into bloom.

Cherry blossom.

Rhododendrons -

here in their natural home they form great forests

and fill the landscape with the covers of a new season.

These forests are a host to a rich variety of springtime migrants.

Beneath the blooms - another display.

It's the mating season for oriental pheasants,

Himalayan monal,

tragopan

and blood pheasant.

Musk deer make the most of a short flash of spring foods.

This male smells a potential mate.

The red panda, rarely glimpsed in the wild.

It was once considered a kind of raccoon,

but is now believed to be a small mountain bear.

By midsummer its larger, more famous relative, has retreated into a cave.

A giant panda nurses a tiny week old baby.

Her tender cleaning wards off infection.

She won't leave this cave for three weeks,

not while her cub is so utterly helpless.

Progress is slow

for milk produced on a diet of bamboo is wretchedly poor.

Four weeks old

and the cub is still blind.

Its eyes do not fully open until three months after birth,

but the chances of the cub reaching adulthood are slim.

The struggle of a giant panda mother to raise her cub

is a touching symbol of the precariousness of life in the mountains.

On the highest summits of our planet

nothing can live permanently.

The highest peak of all,

Mount Everest, five and a half miles above sea level

and still rising - the roof of our world.

Of those humans who've tried to climb it

one in ten have lost their lives.

Those that succeed can stand for only a few moments on its summit.

The Nepalese call it 'a mountain so high no bird can fly above it.'

But each year over 50,000 demoiselle cranes

set out on one of the most challenging migrations on Earth.

To reach their overwintering grounds in India

they must cross the Himalayas.

By late morning ferocious winds are roaring past the peaks.

The cranes must gain height to avoid the building storm.

They've hit serious turbulence.

They must turn back

or risk death.

A new day

and a new opportunity.

The flock stay in close contact by calling one another.

Weak from lack of food and water,

they use thermals, rising columns of warm air, to gain height.

For many this is their first journey across the Himalayas.

For some, it will be their last.

The golden eagles have been expecting them.

The eagles work in pairs to separate a young crane from the flock.

It escapes the touches of one,

and is caught by another.

But even a young crane is a heavy prize

and the eagle has to struggle to control it.

The mother can wait no longer -

this is a desperate race against worsening weather.

The rest of the flock battle on.

In the ascent every wing beat becomes an exhausting struggle.

At last they are over the highest barrier that lies in their way.

But like all who visit the world of the high mountains

they dare not linger. Only 3 percent of the water
on our planet is fresh.

Yet these precious waters
are rich with surprise.

All life on land is ultimately
dependent upon fresh water.

The mysterious tepuis of Venezuela -

isolated mountain plateaus
rising high above the jungle.

This was the inspiration
for Arthur Conan Doyle's 'Lost World,'

an imagined prehistoric land.

Here, strange towers of sandstone
have been sculptured over the millennia

by battering wind and torrential rain.

Moisture rising as water vapour
from the surface of the sea

is blown inland by wind.

On reaching mountains,
the moisture is forced upwards

and as it cools, it condenses
into cloud and finally rain -

the source of all fresh water.

There is a tropical downpour here
almost every day of the year.

Fresh water's journey starts here,
high in the mountains.

Growing from humble streams
to mighty rivers

it will travel hundreds
of miles to the sea.

Angel Falls,
the highest waterfall in the world.

Its waters drop unbroken
for almost a thousand metres.

Such is the height of these falls

that long before the water reaches
the base in the Devil's Canyon

it's blown away as a fine mist.

In their upper reaches,

mountain streams are full of energy.

Streams join to form rivers,

building in power,

creating rapids.

The water here is cold.

Low in nutrients, but high in oxygen.

The few creatures
that live in the torrent

have to hang on for dear life.

Invertebrates dominate
these upper reaches.

The hellgrammite, its body flattened
to reduce drag,

has bushy gills to extract
oxygen from the current.

Black fly larvae anchor themselves
with the ring of hooks,

but if these become unstuck,

they're still held
by a silicon safety line.

There are advantages to life in the fast stream -

bamboo shrimps can just sit
and sift out passing particles

with their fan-like forearms.

Usually, these mountain streams
only provide enough food

for small animals to survive.

But with the spring melt here in Japan

monsters stir in their dens.

Giant salamanders, world's largest amphibian,

almost two metres long.

They're the only large predator
in these icy waters.

They begin their hunt
at night.

These salamanders have
an exceptionally slow metabolism.

Living up to 80 years
they grow into giants.

The fish they hunt are scarce

and salamanders have poor eyesight.

But sensory nodes
on their head and body

detect the slightest changes
in water pressure.

Free from competition,

these giants can dine alone.

Pickings are usually thin
for the salamanders,

but every year some
of the world's high rivers

are crowded by millions of visitors.

The salmon have arrived.

This is the world's largest
fresh water fish migration.

Across the northern hemisphere

salmon, returning from the ocean
to their spawning grounds,

battle their way
for hundreds of miles upstream.

Up here, there are fewer predators
to eat their eggs and fry.

A grizzly bear.

From famine to feast -

he's spoilt for choice.

This Canadian bear is very special -

he's learnt to dive for his dinner.

But catching salmon in deep water
is not that easy

and the cubs have lots to learn.

The annual arrival
of spawning salmon

brings huge quantities
of food into these high rivers

that normally struggle
to support much life.

Although relatively lifeless,

the power of the upland rivers
to shape the landscape

is greater than any other stage
in a river's life.

Driven by gravity,

they're the most erosive forces
on the planet.

For the past 5 million years

Arizona's Colorado river
has eaten away at the desert's sandstone

to create a gigantic canyon.

It's over a mile deep

and at its widest
it's 17 miles across.

The Grand Canyon.

This river has cut
the world's longest canyon system -

a 1,000 mile scar
clearly visible from space.

As rivers leave the mountains behind,

they gradually warm
and begin to support more life.

Indian rivers are home
to the world's most social otter -

smooth-coated otters
form family groups up to 17 strong.

Group rubbing not only
refreshes their coats,

but strengthens social bonds.

When it comes to fishing

there is real strength in numbers.

Fishing practice begins
when the cubs are four months old.

Only the adults have the speed
and agility needed to make a catch.

Adults share their catches
with their squabbling cubs.

Most otters are solitary,

but these rich warm waters
can support large family groups

and even bigger predators.

Mugger crocodiles, four metres long,
could easily take a single otter.

But, confident in their gangs,

the otters will actively harass
these great reptiles.

Team play wins the day.

The Mara river,

snaking across the plains
of East Africa.

As the land flattens out

rivers slow down
and lose their destructive power.

Now they are carrying
heavy loads of sediment

that stains their waters brown.

Lines of wildebeest are on their march.

Each year nearly two million animals
migrate across the Serengeti plains

in search of fresh green pastures.

For these thirsty herds

the rivers are not only
a vital source of drinking water,

but also dangerous obstacles.

This is one of the largest concentrations
of Nile crocodiles in Africa,

giants that grow over five metres long.

From memory, the wildebeest are coming

and gather in anticipation.

The crocodile's jaws
snap tight like a steel trap -

once they have a hold,
they never let go.

It took over an hour
to drown this full-grown bull.

To surprise their prey

crocodiles must strike
with lightning speed.

Here, only the narrowest line
separates life from death.

Most rivers drain into the sea,

but some end their journey
in vast lakes.

Worldwide lakes hold twenty times
more fresh water than all the rivers.

The East African Rift Valley
holds three of the world's largest:

Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria.

Lake Malawi, the smallest of the three,

is still bigger than Wales.

Its tropical waters teem
with more fish species

than any other lake.

There are 850 different cichlids alone,

all of which evolved
from just one single ancestor

isolated here thousands of years ago.

These two-metre wide craters
are fish-made.

Fastidiously maintained by the males,

these bowls are courtship arenas.

Cichlids are caring parents.

Brooding young in the mouth
is a very effective way of protecting them.

This lake can be a dangerous place.

After dark, predatory dolphin fish
emerge from their daytime lairs among the rocks.

Like packs of sharks,
they're on the prowl for sleeping cichlids.

In the darkness these electric fish hunt

by detecting distortions in the electric
field they create around their bodies.

Any cichlid that trenches out
will be snapped up.

The floor of Lake Malawi
drops 700 metres into an abyss.

Here, in this dead zone

the larvae of lake fly midges
hide out away from predators.

In the rainy season
they balloon up to the surface

and undergo a magical transformation.

At dawn the first adult midges
start to break out.

Soon, millions upon millions
of newly hatched lake flies

are taking to the wing.

Early explorers told tales
of lakes that smoked, as if on fire.

But these spiralling columns
hundreds if metres high

are mating flies.

Once the flies have mated,

they will all drop
to the water surface,

release their eggs and die.

Malawi may look like an inland sea,

but it's dwarfed
by the world's largest lake -

Baikal in Eastern Siberia.

400 miles long and over a mile deep,

Baikal contains one fifth
of all the fresh water

found in our planet's
lakes and rivers.

For five months of the year
it's sealed by an ice sheet over a metre thick.

Baikal is the oldest lake in the world

and, despite the harsh conditions,
life flourishes here in isolation.

80 percent of its species
are found nowhere else on Earth,

including the world's
only fresh water seal.

With this seal

and its marine-like forests of sponges

Baikal seems more like
an ocean than a lake.

There are shrimp-like crustaceans -
giant amphipods - as large as mice.

They are the key scavengers
in this lake.

The water here is just too cold for the bacteria
that normally decompose the dead.

Most rivers do not end in lakes

but continue their journey
to the sea.

The planet's indisputable super-river
is the Amazon.

It carries as much water
as the next top-ten biggest rivers combined.

Rising in the Peruvian Andes,
its main trunk flows eastwards across Brazil.

On its way the system drains
a third of South America.

Eventually, over 4,000 miles
from its source,

it empties into the Atlantic Ocean.

The Amazon transports
a billion tonnes of sediment a year,

sediment clearly visible
at the mixing of the waters

where one massive tributary,
the Rio Negro, flows into the main river.

Its waters are wonderfully rich.

To date over 3,000 species
of their fish have been described -

more than in the whole
of the Atlantic Ocean.

The Amazon is so large
and rich in fish

that it can support
fresh water dolphins.

These botos are huge -
two and a half metres long.

In these murky waters they rely
on sonar to navigate and hunt.

They work together to drive
shoals of fish into the shallows.

Botos are highly social

and in the breeding season
there is stiff competition for mates.

The males hold court
in a unique way.

They pick up rocks in their jaws

and flaunt them
to their attending females.

Maybe each male is trying to show
how strong and dexterous he is

and that he therefore is the best father
a female could have for her young.

Successful displays lead to mating.

Even for giant rivers like the Amazon

the journey to the sea
is not always smooth or uninterrupted.

Iguassu Falls on the border
of Brazil and Argentina

is one of the widest waterfalls
in the world -

one and a half miles across.

In flood 30 million litres
of water spill over every second.

All the world's
great broad waterfalls:

Victoria, Niagara and here, Iguassu,

are only found
in the lower courses of their rivers.

In their final stages

rivers broaden and flow wearily
across their flat flood plains.

Each wet season here, in Brazil,

the Parana river overflows its banks

and floods an area
the size of England.

The Pantanal -

the world's largest wetland.

In these slow-flowing waters
aquatic plants flourish

like the Victoria giant water lily
with leaves two metres across.

These underwater forests
are nursery grounds for fish.

Over 300 species breed here,
including red-bellied piranha

and other predators,
like the spectacle caiman.

Ripening fig trees
overhanging the water's edge

provide welcome food
for shoals of hungry fish.

The commotion attracts dorado,

known locally as the river tiger.

They patrol the feeding shoals,

looking for a chance to strike.

And waiting in the wings,

ready to pick off any injured fish,

are the piranhas.

The feeding frenzy quickly develops.

Piranha can strip a fish
to the bone in minutes.

Great numbers of fish
sustain vast flocks of water birds.

The rose-eared spoonbill is just one of the 650
bird species found in the Pantanal.

They nest alongside wood stocks
in colonies thousands strong.

Spectacle caiman linger below,

waiting for a meal
to fall out of the sky.

When rivers finally reach the sea

they slow down, release
their sediment and build deltas.

In Bangladesh the Ganges
and Brahmaputra rivers join

to form the world's biggest.

Every year almost 2 thousand
million tonnes of sediment

eroded from the Himalayas
is delivered to the ocean.

At the delta's mouth -
the largest mangrove forest in the world,

the Sundarbans.

These extraordinary forests
spring up throughout the tropics

in these tidal zones
where rivers meet the sea.

Crab-eating macaques
are mangrove specials.

In Indonesia these monkeys have
adopted a unique amphibious lifestyle -

they fish out fallen food.

The troop also uses the waters
to cool off during the heat of the day.

But the channels are also the playground
for restless young macaques.

Some of the young have even taken
to underwater swimming.

They can stay down
for more than 30 seconds

and appear to do this
just for fun.

Yet these swimming skills
acquired during play

will certainly be useful later in life
in these flooded mangrove forests.

In cooler climes, mud, laid down in estuaries,

is colonised by salt marsh grasses

and form one of the most
productive habitats on the planet.

400,000 greater snow geese flock to the estuaries
along the Atlantic coast of the United States

to rest and refuel
on their long migratory journeys.

This is the end of the river's journey.

Collectively they've
worn down mountains

and carried them to the sea.

And all along the way,

their fresh water has brought life
and abundance to planet Earth. This is our planet's final frontier.

An inner world, where only ...

the most adventurous dare to go.

Beneath our feet,

are countless miles
of cave shafts and passages.

The "Cave of Swallows" in Mexico,

400 meters to the bottom,

deep enough to engulf
the "Empire State Building".

This is the biggest
cave shaft in the world.

Yet these depths were
first explored ...

only 2 years before
man landed on the moon.

Today, caves remain
the least explored places on Earth.

However, human beings
are seldom the first ...

to reach these black, damp places.

Here, live some of the strangest
and least-known animals on the planet.

This galaxy of little lights is created
by thousands of living creatures.

Any animal that lives in a cave
has to cope with complete blackness.

But in New Zealand, some have turned
this darkness to their advantage.

A silicon strand is lowered
from the ceiling,

alongside hundreds of others.

Beautiful though these threads are,

they have a sinister purpose.

This is a cave glow worm.

To trap its prey,
it goes fishing with a line of silk.

The silk comes from glands
in the glow worm's mouth ...

and is loaded
with droplets of mucus.

Each glow worm produces
dozens of these threads.

Once its lines are set,

the glow worm hangs
from a mucus hammock ...

and waits, like a patient angler.

But the glow worm doesn't leave
everything to chance.

That ghostly blue light is the
result of a chemical reaction ...

taking place inside
a special capsule in its tail.

The light literally shines
out of its backside.

It's a lure for attracting prey.

Insects seem irresistibly drawn
towards the source ...

and then get trapped
by the sticky lines.

Once stuck,

there is no escape.

Now it's just a matter
of reeling in the line ...

and slowly consuming
the catch — alive.

By ensnaring the insects
that hatch in this cave,

these glow worms have solved
the biggest challenge ...

that permanent cave dwellers face —

finding a regular
and reliable source of food.

One kind of rock makes this whole
underground world possible —

limestone.

Most of the world's caves
are found within it ...

and it covers nearly 10%
of the Earth's surface.

Limestone is composed of minerals
derived from marine shells and corals,

so although this rocky escarpment
in the United States ...

is now hundreds of meters
above sea level,

it was actually formed under water.

The limestone towers
of Vietnam's "Ha Long Bay" ...

are a reminder
of this link with the sea.

Originally, this whole area would have
been one solid block of limestone,

the base of a coral reef.

In Borneo, rain has sculptured the limestone
into extremely sharp-sided pinnacles.

But the dissolving power
of rainwater ...

has other, much more dramatic
effects underground.

Rivers that flow over limestone
often seem to completely disappear.

When the water reaches the more
resistant bed of limestone ...

its course is altered.

Once underground,

the water takes on
a new, more erosive power.

During its journey
from the surface,

the water absorbed carbon dioxide
from the soil,

making it mildly acidic.

And over millions of years this
acid eats away the limestone,

creating a maze
of caverns and passages ...

that sometimes go on for miles.

This is the biggest underground
river passage in the world,

so big a jumbo jet
could fly through it.

It's "Deer Cave" in Borneo.

The sheer size of Deer Cave ...

allows some animals
to gather there in huge numbers.

A staggering 3 million
wrinkle-lipped bats live here.

The bats roost high
on the walls and ceilings ...

where they're well protected
from the outside elements ...

and safe from predators.

And while they're up here,

the bats produce
something very important.

This 100 meter high mound is made
entirely of bat droppings —

guano.

Its surface is covered
by a thick carpet of cockroaches,

hundreds of thousands of them.

Caves are one of the few habitats on
Earth not directly powered by sunlight.

In the absence of plants,

this food chain is based on a
continuous supply of bat droppings.

The cockroaches feed
on the guano ...

and anything that falls into it.

The droppings also support
other types of cockroaches,

which spend part of their day
resting on cave walls.

These in turn become food
for giant cave centipedes,

some more than 20 centimeters long.

Bizarrely,
there are crabs here, too,

sifting through the droppings
for nutrients.

All these animals spend their
entire lives within the cave.

They're totally dependant on the
digested remains of food ...

that's brought here from outside.

Each evening in just 2 hours,

3 million bats leave
the safety of the cave ...

to hunt for insects
in the forest outside.

But not all will return.

As they leave the cave ...

the stream of bats form
a doughnut-shaped ring.

The wheeling bats seem
to confuse a rufus-bellied eagle,

but they must still survive the attacks
of other, more specialized, birds of prey.

Peregrine falcons and bat hawks
are the jet-fighters of the bird world.

Good hunting will end
as the light fades,

so the bat hawks bolt
their catches on the wing ...

and fly straight back for more.

Any bat separated from the group ...

becomes a clear and obvious target
and is asking for trouble.

Yet the nightly onslaught has
little impact on bat numbers —

by the morning the vast majority
will be back in the safety of the cave.

Bats are not the only commuters
in these Bornean caves.

There's a day shift as well.

Returning from hunting
in the sunlight,

these commuters rely
on their loud clicks ...

to find their way through the cave
passages in total darkness.

They're cave swiftlets.

Like bats, they use
echolocation to navigate.

We need lights
to see what's going on,

but in the pitch black
the swiftlets manage ...

unerringly to locate
their individual nesting sites,

which are only
a few centimeters across.

It's a remarkable skill and one
we still do not fully understand.

These birds are unusual
for another reason.

Their little cup-like nests are
made entirely from threads of saliva.

It takes more than 30 days
to complete one.

The nests are very precious objects,

and not only for the birds.

For 500 years people have been
harvesting the nests of cave swiftlets.

It's a very risky business.

With virtually no
safety equipment,

and using ladders
made from forest vines,

the gatherers climb into the
highest reaches of the cave,

often more than 60 meters
from the floor.

The work may be hazardous
in the extreme,

but the rewards are great.

The pure white nests
of cave swiftlets ...

are the main ingredient
of birds' nest soup,

and gram for gram,
are worth as much as silver.

As soon as its nest is removed,
a bird will immediately build another.

So, as long as this valuable
harvest is properly controlled,

the colonies will continue
to flourish.

These Bornean caves are among
the biggest in the world,

and they're still
getting bigger ...

as each year rainwater
eats away a little more limestone.

But water in caves
doesn't only erode.

It also builds.

This water is loaded
with dissolved limestone,

and when it meets
the air in the cave,

some of that is deposited
as a mineral —

calcite.

As it builds up,

so the calcite forms decorations
that hang from the ceiling —

stalactites.

Each drop leaves behind
only a miniscule amount of calcite,

but over time the process
can produce some spectacular results.

If the water seeps
though the ceiling quickly,

then the calcite is deposited
on the floor of the cave ...

and that creates stalagmites.

Variations in water flow
and the air currents ...

produce an infinite variety of forms,
but all are created by the same process —

the slow deposition
of dissolved limestone.

And when stalactite
meets stalagmite,

a column is born.

Structures like these in
North America's "Carlsbad Cavern" ...

can take many thousands
of years to develop.

But sometimes, the formations
in a cave stop growing altogether.

These flooded caves in Mexico have remained
virtually unchanged for thousands of years.

Since the last Ice Age, they've become
cut off from the outside world.

Yet their impact on life
on the surface has been huge.

500 years ago, they supported one of
the world's great civilizations:

The Maya.

Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula has
no rivers, lakes or streams ...

so the Maya relied on the cenotes —

the flooded entrances
to the water-filled caves.

These flooded shafts are the region's
only source of open fresh water.

The cenotes are in effect,
gigantic fresh water wells.

Away from the life-giving rays
of sunshine,

one might not expect
to find plants.

But in the darkness
of the cave tunnels,

roots of giant tropical trees,

have pushed their way through
cracks in the limestone ...

to reach the flooded caverns.

Without this water,

the Yucatan's forest
could not grow so luxuriantly.

The Maya knew that their lives
depended on this water,

but it's only with the help
of today's technology,

that we've come to appreciate the
full significance and scale ...

of these flooded passageways.

So far,

more than 350 miles of underwater
galleries in the Yucatan ...

have been mapped,

but still nobody yet knows the true
extend of this subterranean waterworld.

And with good reason.

Underwater caving
is notoriously dangerous.

When the nearest exit may be
hundreds of meters or more away,

running out of air
down here would be fatal.

To avoid getting lost,

divers carry with them
a spool of string.

It becomes their lifeline —

literally.

The string also doubles
as a measuring tape —

a technique that has been
used here in Mexico ...

to chart the largest
underwater cave in the world —

all 100 miles of it.

Cave exploration often requires
you ...

to push yourself through
narrow gaps in the rock.

Cavers call such places 'squeezes'.

The tighter the squeeze,

the greater the chance of damaging
some vital life-support system.

In these conditions a diver could
easily become disorientated,

and that could be fatal.

The flooded caverns can play
tricks on you in other ways.

What seems like air,

isn't.

It's just another kind of water.

This is a halocline —

a meeting of fresh and salt water.

Fresh water from the jungle flows over
the heavier salt water from the sea.

The saltwater layer is extremely
low in oxygen ...

making it a particularly
difficult place for animals to live.

Yet some have managed it,

like the remiped, one of the most
ancient of all living crustaceans.

The Maya understood
the importance of the cenotes,

but they could never have known that
these flooded passageways ...

were actually the beginning
of subterranean rivers,

all of which eventually
flow out to the sea.

Salt water, unlike fresh water,
does not erode limestone,

so most sea caves are created by the
mechanical pounding of the waves.

The rocky outcrops of New Zealand's
"Poor Knight Islands" ...

are riddled with sea caves ...

and just like those in Borneo ...

they have become important shelters
for many species.

After a day feeding
in the open water ...

vast shoals of demoiselle fish
return to the caves,

which they use
as a refuge from predators.

For these fish, the caves
are a night time retreat,

but they're not
the only commuters in here.

There are other fish
working to a different schedule.

The big eyes are
the equivalent of bats.

Night feeders leave
the cave each evening.

And like all cave commuters,

they are most vulnerable
at the scheduled time of departure.

A bottleneck funnels these exiting
bats into dense concentrations,

attracting the attention of others.

The bats can detect the snakes
using echolocation,

but the snakes are literally
in the dark —

they can see nothing.

The strikes seem
to be largely hit-and-miss,

but the snakes have
a secret weapon.

They can actually sense
each bat flying past.

Receptors in the snake's head pick up
the heat given off by the flying bats,

as this thermal image shows.

To the snakes, the bats are
apparently glowing ...

and this gives them
something to aim at.

This is the price that these
cave commuters must pay ...

for their daytime sanctuary
on the ground.

Small wonder then that there are
other cave dwellers that stay put.

Many caves are like islands —

cut off from the outside world
and from other caves.

This isolation, has resulted
in the evolution ...

of some various strange creatures.

They are the cave specialists —

troglodytes, animals that never emerge
from the caves or see daylight.

These troglodytes from Thailand ...

are possibly the most specialized
creatures on Earth ...

for they live only
in cave waterfalls.

The entire population
of these cave angel fish ...

seems to be restricted
to just two small caves.

It's the same story
with other troglodytes.

There may well be less than a 100
Texas cave salamanders in the wild.

And the Belizean white crab
is another creature ...

that is unique
to just one cave system.

Living in perpetual darkness ...

they have all not only lost
the pigment in their skin,

but also their eyes.

It takes thousands of generations
for eyes to be lost,

so these species must have been
isolated for a very long time.

But the blind salamander has other
highly developed sensory organs.

Receptors in their skin detect minute
movements in the water made by its prey.

External gills help it to breathe in
water that is particularly low in oxygen.

The cave angel fish feed on bacteria
in the fast flowing water ...

keeping their grip
with microscopic hooks on their fins.

Food is often in short supply,

and troglodytes like the crab,

have to survive on whatever washes
into the cave from outside.

The salamander might not encounter
food for several months,

so when something does come along,

it can't afford to miss it.

It's astonishing that these extraordinary
cave dwellers manage to survive at all.

But one cave is so inhospitable ...

that one would not expect it
to contain any life whatsoever.

The water flowing out of the
"Villa Luz" cave in Mexico ...

is actually colored white
with sulphuric acid.

Explorers entering
this dangerous cave ...

must wear respirators
and carry monitors.

Poisonous gases rise
to fatal levels so quickly,

that an early warning system
is essential.

Bats survive by staying
close to the skylights,

but venturing deep into the cave
is very dangerous indeed.

The source of these toxic fumes
lies several miles below.

Hydrogen sulphide gas bubbles up
from oil deposits in the earth's crust.

It mixes with oxygen and the water,

and forms sulphuric acid.

These are not the sort of conditions
in which you would expect to find fish,

yet these cave mollies
seem to thrive,

despite the acid
and the low levels of oxygen.

There is, in fact, more life here
than anyone would think possible,

but the biggest surprise
is something altogether more bizarre.

These strange stalactite-like formations
are known, rather appropriately, as snotites,

the drops dripping
from the ends are sulphuric acid,

strong enough to burn skin.

The snotites are in fact,
vast colonies of bacteria,

capable of growing a centimeter a day.

In this world without sunlight,

these bacteria extract energy
from the hydrogen sulphide gas.

Bacteria like these
are known as extremofiles ...

because of their ability to survive
in such extreme conditions.

And these extremofiles play
another important role in this cave.

Surprisingly, they are
the basis of a food chain ...

which supports, amongst other creatures,
the larvae of these midges.

Villa Luz's ecosystem
was certainly very remarkable,

but cave explorers were soon to make
an even more astonishing discovery.

Beneath this arid landscape,
lies a subterranean wonderland.

Without water, one might not
expect to find any caves,

but beneath these rolling desert
slopes in the United States ...

lies one of the longest, deepest
and most surprising caves in the world.

Its secrets remained unknown
until 1986,

when cavers dug through
several meters of loose rock ...

to the bottom of this pit.

They named the cave 'Lechuguilla' ...

and since this discovery, more than 120
miles of passageways have been mapped.

When the first explorers descended,

no one guessed
at the sheer size of this cave.

But even that was not going
to be the biggest surprise.

Little did they realize
that Lechuguilla ...

would soon be regarded
by cavers the world over ...

as the most beautiful
of all caves.

They were about to discover ...

some of the most exquisite formations
ever seen underground.

The walls were covered with the
most delicate and fragile crystals.

Many of these crystals
were made of gypsum,

a mineral that comes
from limestone.

And there was mile after mile.

Water is the creator
of most caves,

but,
unlike all other limestone caves,

Lechuguilla's rock had not been
eaten away by running rainwater.

Something else was responsible.

The only water Lechuguilla has are
these wonderfully still clear pools.

As the explorers went deeper
into the cave,

they came across whole galleries
filled with the most unusual formations,

like these 5-meter cones,
frosted with the most delicate crystals.

It was Lechuguilla's
gypsum crystals ...

that made scientists question
how these caverns were formed.

They discovered, that
Lechuguilla's limestone ...

had actually been eaten away
by sulphuric acid,

cutting through literally miles
of limestone.

And when sulphuric acid
dissolves limestone,

it leaves behind gypsum,

the basis of Lechuguilla's
remarkable formations.

And there was one set,

more than a mile from the surface,

that almost defied belief.

The Chandelier Ballroom
was the ultimate discovery.

With its six-meter
long crystals ...

it's surely the most bizarre
cave chamber in the world.

And the walls had
one further surprise.

Extremofile bacteria were found
to be feeding on the rock itself.

The discovery of life that exists without
drawing any of its energy from the sun ...

shows us once again how complex and
surprising the underground world can be.

Each year, explorers chart over
a hundred miles of new cave passages.

But with half the world's
limestone still to be explored,

who knows how many Lechuguillas
are still waiting to be discovered? A third of the land
on our planet is desert.

These great scars
on the face of the Earth

appear to be lifeless,

but surprisingly none are.

In all of them life manages somehow

to keep a precarious hold.

Not all deserts are hot.

Fifty-mile-an-hour winds
blowing in from Siberia

bring snow to the Gobi Desert
in Mongolia.

From a summer high
of 50 degrees centigrade

the temperature in midwinter
can drop to minus 40,

making this one
of the harshest deserts of all.

Few animals can survive
these extreme changes.

Wild Bactrian camels,

one of the rarest mammals
on the planet.

And perhaps the hardiest.

Their biggest problem
is the lack of water,

particularly now, in winter,

when the little there is
is locked up as ice.

Surprisingly, snow here never melts.

The air is just too cold
and too dry for it to do so.

The sun's rays turn it
straight into vapour.

It evaporates.

But it is the only source
of water,

so Bactrian camels eat it.

Elsewhere in the world

a camel at a waterhole can drink
as much as 200 litres during a single visit.

Here the strategy is to take little and often.

And with good reason,

for filling the stomach
with snow could be fatal.

The camels must limit themselves

to the equivalent
of just 10 litres a day.

Winter is the time
for breeding.

This extraordinary performance
is a male Bactrian camel's way

of attracting the attention
of a passing female.

In summer the camels can't stray
far from waterholes.

But now, with mouthfuls
of snow lying everywhere

they can travel widely
in search of mates.

Today less than a thousand of these desert
specialists remain in the wild.

The Gobi, hostile though it is,
is their last stronghold.

There's no other desert
quite like the Gobi,

but why is this place a desert?

There is one simple
and massive cause -

the Himalayas.

Clouds blowing from the south
hit this gigantic barrier.

As they're forced upwards

so they empty their moisture
on the mountain slopes,

leaving little for the land
on the other side.

From the space
deserts are very conspicuous.

Dunes of sand hundreds of miles long
streak their surface.

With no cloak of vegetation
to conceal them

strange formations are exposed
in the naked rock.

Africa's Sahara is
the largest desert of all.

It's the size
of the United States

and the biggest source of sand
and dust in the entire world.

Sandstorms like these
appear without warning

and reduce visibility for days
over areas the size of Britain.

Dromedaries, single-humped camels,
take these storms in their stride.

The heaviest sand rises only
a few metres above the ground,

but the dust can be blown
5,000 metres up into the sky.

The ferocious wind,
armed with grains of sand,

is the agent that shapes all deserts.

Reptiles have armoured scaly skins
that protect them from the stinging grains.

For insects the bombardment
can be very severe indeed.

The only escape
is below the surface.

As the winds rise and fall, swallow and eddy

so they pile the sand into dunes.

These sand scenes can be
hundreds of miles across.

In Namibia the winds have built
some of the biggest dunes in the world.

Star dunes like these
can be 300 metres high.

Grains, swept up the flanks,
are blown off the crests of the ridges

so it's only the tops
that are moving.

The main body of these dunes
may not have shifted for 5,000 years.

Few rocks can resist the continuous
blast of the sand carrying wind.

These outcrops are standing
in Egypt's White Desert.

But they will not do so
for much longer.

They're being inexorably
chiseled away

and turned into more sand.

Now lumps of heavily eroded rocks
have been marooned in a sea of sand.

These jagged pyramids
a hundred metres tall

were once part
of a continuous rocky plateau.

The blasting sand will eventually
eliminate them altogether.

The relentless power of the wind ensures
that the face of a desert is continually changing.

But there is one constant presence -

the desert sun.

The sun's heat and power
to evaporate water

has had a profound effect on the bodies
and habits of everything that lives here.

This sun potentially is a killer.

And the red kangaroos
must acknowledge that.

Right now, while the sun is low,

there's no immediate cause
for concern.

But this situation won't last long.

Australia is the world's most arid continent
with blistering daytime temperatures.

Every hour the temperature rises
by five degrees centigrade.

Soon the heat will reach
a critical point.

Any kangaroo out in the open
is in serious danger of overheating.

In the full sun the temperature
on the ground soars to 70 degrees.

By midday the radiation is
so intense they must take shelter.

In the shade they're shielded
from much of the sun's energy

but their body temperature
can still rise.

So they lick saliva
on to their forearms

where there is a network of blood vessels
close to the surface of the skin

and, as the saliva evaporates,
their blood is cooled.

This thermal image shows
just how effective the process is.

The blue areas on the body
are the cooler parts.

As the saliva dries
it has to be replaced

and this is a real drain
on the kangaroo's body fluids.

Even in the shade
the earth is baking hot

so the kangaroos dig away
the warmed topsoil

to get at the cooler ground beneath.

By staying in the shade and licking
to control their body temperature

kangaroos manage to get
through the hottest part of the day

without heat stroke.

But for the majority
of desert animals

this strategy would not be
enough for survival.

The extraordinary ears
of the fennec foxes of Africa radiate heat

but the animals have
another way of keeping cool.

They spend their days underground

and only emerge at sunset.

Darkness brings huge changes.

In the Sahara the temperature can drop
as much as 30 degrees during the night,

so it's cool enough to allow
these desert fox cubs to play.

All sorts of creatures now appear

including some really unexpected ones.

Toads have permeable skins

and would quickly die from desiccation
out in the daytime heat.

It's only now that
they can leave shelter.

The same is true for scorpions,

even though their shells
are actually watertight.

In fact, most small desert
creatures are nocturnal.

so it's only now
that you can judge

just how much life
there can be in the desert.

But moisture, lost even at night,
has to be replaced sometime somehow

and that problem dominates
the lives of all desert dwellers.

The Atacama in Chile.

This is the driest desert
in the world.

Some parts may not see rain
for fifty years

and with such a record

you'd expect the place
to be completely barren.

These are South America's camels,
guanacos.

They're very good
at conserving moisture

but they nonetheless
need a regular supply of water.

They get it partly
from cactus flowers

but that explanation
raises another question.

How do the cacti
survive without rain?

Hot winds suck all the moisture
from the surface of the land.

Clearly there must be something else
that takes the place of rain.

The secret is a cold sea current
that runs parallel to the land.

The cold water cools
the moist warm air above it

and that produces banks of fog.

At the same time wind blowing
on to the shore sweeps the fog inland.

Before long the cacti
are dripping with dew.

The fog is so regular

that moisture loving lichens
are able to grow on the cacti

and they absorb liquid
like a sponge.

In the land of almost no rain

these precious drops are life-savers
for many different creatures.

Further inland the air remains so warm
that its moisture does not condense

so this slender strip of desert
is virtually the only part of the Atacama

where life can exist.

Without the fog,

this land, too, would be empty.

The guanacos make
the most of the dew

but it will not remain
for long.

In an hour or two
the sun will have burnt it off

and dry the surface of the cacti.

The Sonoran desert in Arizona
is not quite so dry as the Atacama -

some rain does fall.

But it is infrequent

and when it does arrive

animals and plants have
to be ready to make the most of it.

And it's coming.

When the summer monsoon blows in

the giant saguaros,
one of the biggest of all cacti,

are ready to take
full advantage of it.

After a rainstorm the saguaro's long shallow
root system sucks up the water

and the pleats on its trunk
enable it to expand rapidly.

When full, a saguaro stem can store
up to five tonnes of water

and that's enough to see it
through many months of drought.

The trunks of these huge plants
provide homes for the gila woodpecker.

But birds are not the only animals
to benefit from the presence of the cacti.

During four weeks of the summer

the saguaros bloom at night
to attract visitors.

The pollen and nectar
with which these flowers are loaded

attract long-nosed and long-tongued bats.

The bats left Mexico a few days earlier
to escape the heat of summer

and are on their way north
to the southern United States.

To get there, they have
to cross the Sonoran desert.

But the desert is so big

that for most of the year
they would be unable to cross it.

Now, with the saguaro in bloom,

they can refuel on the way.

So the saguaro's success
in developing a way to store water

is now crucial to most of the animals
that live or even travel through this land.

The scarcity of rain determined
the shape of this icon of the desert

but water, scarce thought it is,

has also, like the wind,
shaped the land itself.

In the deserts of Utah

ancient rivers flowing across sandstone country
steadily widen their canyons

until now the land between them
has been reduced to spires and pinnacles.

With little or no soil to retain
the water on the surface of the land

life here is scarce indeed.

And when resources are limited,

conflict is never far away.

These are Nubian ibex

and they are squaring up
for a duel.

And when trouble starts,

a smart ibex knows that the best thing
to do is to gain higher ground.

These are actually
subordinate male ibex,

but their fights
are nonetheless serious.

Losing one might mean
never getting the chance to breed ever.

When competitors are evenly
matched as they are here,

duels can last for an hour.

In this heat the effort
is trully exhausting.

But victory here will gain important
ranking points on a male's way to the top.

There's so much at stake

that not all play fair.

The battle has produced the winner,

but the ultimate prize
is not his yet.

That currently belongs
to the dominant male ibex.

His rank earns him the loyalty
of a harem of females

and they follow him closely
as he travels across this desert

searching for foof and water.

He doesn't have to waste time
looking for mates -

they're his for the taking,

so he can concentrate with them
on keeping fit and healthy.

Lizards are desert specialists.

But here, their numbers
are extraordinary.

These crevices in South Africa contain
the highest density of lizards in the world.

They're called flat lizards
for obvious reasons,

and they flaunt their multi-coloured
bellies in territorial disputes.

He's made his point,

and now it's time
to find some food.

As the day warms up,

the lizards move away
from their cracks

and head down
to the bottom of the gorge.

Their goal is the river.

There is no food at the edge,

but this desert river
holds a secret.

Each day blackfly rise
from turbulent stretches of the river.

This is what the lizards
have come for.

The black fly never land,

so the lizards have to leap
for their food.

In one day each of these acrobatic
little lizards may catch 50 flies.

There are plenty of flies
to go round,

even with hundreds of lizards
competing for them.

Away from these rapids flat lizard populations
are found much smaller numbers.

But here one unusual abundance
has produced another.

Deserts are created by the lack of water,

but what actually kills animals
here is not heat or thirst,

but lack of food.

So how on earth does
a plant-eater this size

survive in a place apparently
totally devoid of vegetation?

Elephants in Namibia
are the toughest in Africa.

And they need to be.

What little food exists
is so dispersed

that these elephants walk
up to 50 miles a day

as they travel up the dry river channels
searching for something to eat.

At times the task
looks truly helpless.

Elephants may seem out of place
in this landscape,

but they're not the only ones.

Amazingly, lions live here, too.

In savanah country huge herds
of games support prides

containing 20 lions or more.

But to live here
lions have had to change their habits -

prides are much smaller

and their home ranges
are very much bigger.

And there's an added problem -

their food is always on the move.

Like the elephants,

the lions must travel great distances
to find enough to live on.

But lions can't go everywhere -

they won't attempt to cross
this field of sand dunes

and the oryx know it.

The lions must wait for the oryx
to leave the safety of the dunes,

which eventually they must
to find food and water.

And then the lions
will ambush them.

The elephants have found
some of their favourite food.

Grasses are the staple diet
of all elephants,

but this herd concentrates
on digging up the roots,

which have more nutrition
and moisture than the stems.

It's the sort of behaviour

that can make all the difference
in a place of serious shortages.

Yet all this can change
in an instant.

The fortunes of many deserts
are ruled by distant rains.

This water fell as rain
in mountains more than a hundred miles away.

It's known as a flash flood

and called that because the water
may run for just a single day.

It's an event that only happens
once or twice a year at the most.

The sandy riverbed acts like
a giant strip of blotting paper

sucking up the water
as soon as it appears.

But every square metre of soil
moistened by this river

will increase the chances
of survival for those that live here.

Waterholes are filled
temprorarily.

Elsewhere in Africa
elephants drink every day,

but the lack of water here

means that desert elephants can only
refill their tanks once every four or five days.

Within a week the flash flood
has produced a flush of green,

more than enough to draw
the oryx out of the dunes.

It's a rare chance for them
to build up their food reserves.

The flood has made life easier
for the lions, too.

The flesh of this oryx will keep
the family going for a week at the most.

But for a while
the hunting will be easier,

now that river channel
has turned green.

The good times
for lions and oryx are brief,

but these are the short moments

that make it possible to live
in deserts the year round.

Death Valley is the hottest
place on Earth.

Yet even this furnace
can be transformed by water.

A single shower can enable seeds
that have lain dormant for 30 years or more

to burst into life.

And there hasn't been a bloom
like this one for a century.

The periods of boom
in Death Valley are short.

but they're just frequent enough
to keep life ticking over.

A sudden flush of vegetation is
what every desert dweller waits for,

and when it happens
they must make the most of it.

There is no other species
on the planet

that responds as quickly and as dramatically
to the good times as the desert locust.

Eggs that have remained in the ground
for 20 years begin to hatch.

The young locusts
are known as hoppers,

for at this stage
they're flightless.

They find new feeding grounds
by following the smell of sprouting grass.

Normally it takes four weeks
for hoppers to become adults,

but when the conditions
are right as now

their development switches
to the fast track.

As the vegetation in one place
begins to run out

the winged adults release pheromones -
scent messages,

which tell others in the group
that they must move on.

And when groups merge,

they form a swarm.

An adult locust eats
its entire body weight every day,

and a whole swarm can consume
literally hundreds of tonnes of vegetation.

They have to keep on moving.

The swarm travels
with the wind -

it's the most energy-saving
way of flying.

Following the flow of wind means that they're
always heading toward areas of low pressure,

places where wind meets rain
and vegetation starts to grow.

As they fly,

swarms join up with other swarms

to form gigant­­­ic plagues
several billions strong

and as much as 40 miles wide.

They will consume every edible thing
that lies in their path.

This is one of planet Earth's
greatest spectacles.

It's rarely seen on this scale

and it won't last long.

Once the food is gone,

the steady roar of a billion beating
locust wings will once again be replaced

by nothing more
than the sound of the desert wind. Both poles of our planet are covered with ice.

They're the largest
and most demanding wildernesses of all.

Nowhere else on Earth
is seasonal change so extreme.

It causes the ice
to advance and retreat every year.

And all life here is governed by that.

When the first polar explorers headed south,

giant cathedrals of ice marked
their entry into uncharted territory.

Passing the towering spires,

they must have wondered
what unearthly sights lay in store.

As they battled on,
the ice became increasingly dominant,

but nothing could have prepared them
for the ice world that finally loomed into view.

Terra incognita, ''the unknown land''.

At the southernmost extreme of our planet,

the continent of Antarctica is as large
as the United States of America.

Ninety per cent of all the world's ice is found here.

This frozen world is largely deserted
until the start of spring.

Adelie penguins in a hurry.

The clock is ticking.

Instead of waiting for the summer melt,
the new arrivals hasten south over the frozen sea.

They have come here to breed,
but polar summers are so short,

they must be in position before the thaw starts.

As the sea ice retreats,
life can journey farther south.

Antarctic waters are so rich that visitors come
from far and wide to harvest them.

Vast numbers of chinstrap penguins
come ashore to breed.

No bird will lay their eggs directly onto ice

so bare rock is a vital commodity.

The best patches are worth the climb.

The cliff tops are soon stained pink

with the droppings of tens of thousands
of nesting penguins.

0nly in a land almost entirely covered in ice
could bare rock be reckoned an oasis.

Some will travel
into the heart of the continent to find it.

These are nunataks,
the exposed peaks of vast mountain ranges

buried in ice over a mile deep.

The eerie silence here is only broken in spring.

The snow petrels have arrived and are courting.

Antarctic petrels now join
the most southerly bird colony on Earth.

The birds have flown inland
for over 300 miles to reach this breeding site.

0nce their eggs have hatched, they will be forced
repeatedly to make the 600-mile round trip

to gather food in the ocean.

First, though, valuable nesting places
must be defended from property thieves.

After laying their eggs,
the petrels take time out to clean their plumage.

The south polar skua is a formidable opportunist.

But the skuas have not chanced upon the petrels,

they've been waiting for them.

These birds do not need to go
to the ocean for their food.

The skuas can survive further south
than any other predator

by exploiting the petrels' desperate need
for bare rock.

Even at the height of summer, less than
three per cent of Antarctica is free of ice,

and nearly all of that exposed rock
is found in one place,

the Antarctic Peninsula.

Its long arm extends further north
than the rest of the continent,

so spring arrives here first.

The thaw unlocks sheltered bays

that provide refuge from the relentless battering
of the Southern 0cean.

In the depths, something stirs.

Humpback whales.

They have travelled over 5,000 miles
to reach these waters.

The whales are harvesting krill,

shrimp-like creatures that begin to swarm here
as soon as the ice retreats.

Diving into the heart of the swarm,
teams of whales spiral round each other

in close coordination.

Now they turn, blasting air from their blowholes,
and ascend towards their prey.

The krill becomes concentrated
as the spiralling net of bubbles draws inwards.

The team of whales work round the clock
for the boom is short-lived.

Summer is already fading

and the whales will soon
be forced north as winter returns.

The sun's influence diminishes
and the ocean starts to freeze.

The greatest seasonal change
on our planet is underway.

The ice grows at an extraordinary rate,
advancing two and a half miles a day.

In a matter of weeks,
the continent effectively doubles in size.

Life flees from Antarctica.

But one creature is just arriving.

Every winter, emperor penguins
leave the comfort of their ocean home

and begin a remarkable journey.

They head towards their breeding grounds,
almost 100 miles inland.

Eventually, the emperor penguins
reach the place where they were hatched,

an area sheltered by icebergs,
trapped in the frozen ocean.

Here they will raise the next generation.

But first, each must find a mate.

The males begin to serenade.

And if a female replies, they pair up,
posing like statues.

New couples quickly form a strong bond.

They seem oblivious
to the noisy crowd around them.

To cement their relationship,
the male steps out with his female.

The brief courtship complete,
there isn't a moment to lose.

With so much pressure to perform,
any male would struggle to stay on top.

Several weeks later, and it seems
that most couplings were successful.

But producing the egg has taken its toll.

The females no longer
have the energy to incubate.

The male takes over.

It's still minus 20 degrees centigrade,

so the transfer must be done quickly
or else the egg will freeze.

With no bare rock to nest on,
the male tucks the egg into a special pouch,

where he can keep it warm.

It requires an extraordinary piece of teamwork.

Driven by hunger, the exhausted females
now return to the ocean on their own,

repeating the epic journey they made
with the males only a month before.

Now the sun barely appears above the horizon.

As the days shorten,
its warmth is withdrawn from the continent.

With the females gone,
the colony undergoes a strange transformation.

The males shuffle into groups,

their eggs still tucked away above their feet.

They lock together in tightly-packed huddles
as they struggle to keep warm.

Speeding up the action reveals
how these huddles constantly shift and change

as each penguin works its way
towards the warmer interior.

Crammed into this scrum,
the birds are remarkably good-natured.

But they have to be.

If the huddle breaks, even for a moment,
precious heat escapes.

It's imperative they reform as quickly as possible,

for only by acting as one can the males
withstand the elements and protect their eggs.

But their greatest test lies ahead.

As winter advances,
frequent blizzards drive the temperature down.

It's now 60 degrees below zero.

The birds at the edge of the huddle
bear the brunt of the 100-mile-an-hour winds

and so provide shelter
to those taking their turn in the middle.

Abandoned by the sun,
the males are left alone with their eggs

to face the coldest, darkest winter on Earth.

At the northern extreme of our planet,
the sun rises for the first time in months,

illuminating a very different ice world.

Unlike Antarctica,
the Arctic is a vast frozen sea surrounded by land.

Here winter is coming to an end

but this bleak wilderness remains locked in ice.

Eider ducks break the silence.

They have stayed here,
braving the northern winter,

instead of flying south to warmer climes.

Flocks 40,000 strong
sweep across the frozen wastes.

They all have the same goal, a polynya,

a permanent hole in the sea ice,

kept open throughout the winter
by strong ocean currents.

This unusual duck pond
provides an overnight sanctuary

and, when day breaks, a rare chance to feed.

Just 10 metres beneath the ice,
the sea floor is carpeted with dense mussel beds.

These can only be reached
during a brief lull in the currents.

The ducks must quickly prise the mussels free
before the tide starts to turn.

The window of opportunity is short.

As the current begins to build,
it's up, up and away.

These permanent holes in the ice
provide seafood throughout the winter.

The diners attract others.

In the Arctic, any breach in the icy barrier
can be a lifeline.

Musk oxen create their own.

These giants have the strength
to smash through the frozen crust

to graze on the vegetation below.

The ice-breakers create an opening
for other over-winterers.

Flocks of ptarmigan make unusual
grazing companions for the musk oxen,

whose entourage grows throughout the day.

This odd assembly of vegetarians
doesn't go unnoticed.

An arctic fox.

The musk oxen have recently given birth.

For the fox, it's a chance to scavenge.

But half a ton of mad hairy cow
is not to be trifled with.

The calves are born well before the spring melt,

giving them a head start
when summer finally arrives.

It must get to grips with its new ice world,

benign one minute, life-threatening the next.

Even in spring, winds chill to the bone.

The calf must stay close to its mother
to avoid getting lost in the sudden blizzard.

Arctic wolves!

In the whiteout,
the threat is almost impossible to detect,

but the musk oxen
instinctively retreat to higher ground.

Forming a defensive ring around their calves,

the adults present a barricade
that few hunters could breach.

But the wolves need not risk injury today.

A calf has been left behind in the panic.

With each passing day,
the sun climbs higher in the sky

and its rays strike the Arctic more directly.

It's spring and new life stirs.

The polar bear cubs emerge from the den
in which they were born.

Their mother stretches her legs
after five months under the snow.

They are just two months old
and instinctively follow her lead.

A steep slope makes the best site for a den,
but it's a tricky place to take your first steps.

It may look like fun
but this is serious training for the task ahead.

There is no food on the slopes

and the family will need to head out
across the frozen sea

before the mother's milk runs dry.

Two weeks later, they are ready.

0ut on the sea ice, the female can hunt for seals

but it will take all her mothering skills
to keep her cubs safe

in this dangerous world of ice.

The annual melt has begun.

This is a challenging time for the bear family.

0ne out of every two cubs
do not survive their first year out on the ice.

As the sun's influence increases,
the sea ice seems to take on a life of its own.

Glacial melt waters pour from the land,
mingling with the sea

and speeding up the thaw.

The seascape is in constant flux

as broken ice is moved on by winds and currents.

The ice is becoming too weak
to support a male polar bear.

He attempts to spread his weight,

but the ice that has supported him all winter
is rapidly disintegrating.

Each year, as the climate warms,
the Arctic holds less ice.

This is a disaster for polar bears.

Without its solid platform,

they can't hunt the seals
they need in order to survive.

This may be a glimpse of the unstable future

faced by this magnificent creature.

As the ice disappears,
seabirds return to the high Arctic.

Little auks arrive in their millions.

In some ways,
these birds are the penguins of the north.

They seek bare rock on which to lay their eggs
and they look rather like penguins, too.

Unlike Antarctica, the Arctic
can be reached by land-based predators,

which is why little auks
have kept the ability to fly.

They use scree slopes to protect their eggs,
burrowing up to a metre beneath the rocks.

At the height of summer, the sun never sets,

but just skims the horizon before rising again.

Migrants return to the Arctic from far and wide.

They've come to make the most of the brief flush
of food and to produce their young.

Sandhill cranes have travelled
all the way from New Mexico.

Their chicks join the growing band
of youngsters exploring the tundra.

For a few months each year, the Arctic becomes
''The land of the midnight sun''

and 24 hours of daylight
allow animals to feed around the clock.

The arctic fox finally has enough food
to raise her large family.

If you choose to nest in the open,
you must be prepared for a fight.

Arctic skuas will see off any trespassers,
even large vegetarians.

The male polar bear's ice world
has finally vanished beneath him.

While the female is still kept on land
by her dependent cubs,

the male can take to the sea in search of food.

Ducking and diving, he hopes to ambush seals

resting on the remaining fragments of ice.

In these new surroundings,
he is a surprisingly adept swimmer.

0nce an extremely rare sight,

polar bears have recently been seen
over 60 miles from the shore.

There is now no turning back for this bear.

He is forced to head out into deeper water.

His giant front paws help him
to fight the ocean currents.

He seems at home in the sea,
but he cannot swim indefinitely.

He will drown if he doesn't find land
somewhere in this vast ocean.

Walruses are now gathering on low-lying islands.

They gave birth on the sea ice,
but with this platform now gone,

they need a new place
to haul out and nurse their young.

After several days at sea,
the male bear finally makes landfall,

drawn by the pungent smells
emanating from the island.

By the end of the summer,
the bear has lost half his weight.

With the ice long gone,
he is forced onto land in search of food.

There will be no easy meals on this island.

Walruses are the largest seals in the world.

They weigh over a ton
and are armed with tusks a metre long.

Exhausted from his swim,
the bear must regain his strength.

The next day, a sea fog shrouds the island.

The walruses sense that they are in danger.

Using the fog as cover,
the bear approaches the herd.

The adults close ranks around their young,

presenting a wall of blubber and hide.

He tests the barrier, but it stands firm.

It appears that the world's largest land carnivore
has met his match.

There must be a chink in the armour somewhere.

Not here!

This female walrus is shielding her pup,
if he can just prise her off...

The bear's claws and teeth
can't penetrate her thick hide.

With the herd retreating to water,
the bear must move quickly.

Having failed with one,
he heads straight for another.

The chance of his first meal in months
is slipping away.

He seems increasingly desperate.

It's now or never.

He must avoid the stabbing tusks if he is to win.

The flailing walrus is immensely powerful

and drags the bear away from the shallows
towards the safety of the herd.

It slips from his grasp.

0nly at the height of summer,

when bears are on the verge of starvation,
will they risk attacking such dangerous prey.

It was a gamble that this bear took and lost.

The stab wounds he received from the walrus
are so severe that he can barely walk.

The walruses are calm again,

seemingly aware that the injured bear
no longer poses a threat to them or their young.

Unable to feed, this bear will not survive.

If the global climate continues to warm,
and the Arctic ice melts sooner each year,

it is certain that more bears will share this fate.

At the southern end of our planet,
fiery ribbons are illuminating the winter skies.

The aurora australis.

This light brings no warmth to the male penguins,

who are still huddling,
defying the coldest conditions on the planet.

Their ordeal is drawing to a close.

Thirty days after it last set,
the sun rises once more on Antarctica.

Their appalling trials have all been for this.

Each father has just one meal left inside him.

He has been saving it all winter.

This single feed will sustain the chicks
for a few more days,

but the males have not eaten
for nearly four months.

If they do not eat soon,
they and their chicks will die.

But there is hope on the horizon.

The females are returning
and their bellies are full with fish.

As they approach, waves of excitement
ripple through the huddle.

Each female calls to her mate
and he, recognising her song, trumpets back.

Reunited at last.

The mother sees her chick for the first time.

She's keen to start parenting,

but the father needs persuading to surrender
the chick he has been caring for all winter.

He must now put his chick at risk.

In these temperatures it could freeze in seconds.

The male will have to let go.

Eventually, the transfer to the mother
is safely made.

The chicks grow quickly
on a diet of fish and squid.

Soon they are keen to explore,
but always with mother in tow.

This chick is less fortunate,
its mother has not returned to claim it.

Another orphan is searching for a new family,

but this female already has a chick of her own.

Some orphans receive too much mothering

from penguins whose own chicks
have not survived.

The urge to parent is so strong
that they will compete with one another

to adopt any chick they find.

Many of these squabbles end in tragedy
as the poor chick is trampled to death.

Those chicks that do have parents
quickly learn survival skills.

Even in spring,
they must huddle together for warmth,

just as their fathers did in the depths of winter.

A group of chicks has got lost in the blizzard.

Cold and disorientated, they search for the colony.

It will not be long
before the storm claims its first victims.

By early summer,
the chicks are surprisingly well-developed

and now look ready to take on the world.

Those that survive their first year
have the best possible start in life

thanks to the extraordinary hardships
endured by their parents.

Parents who battled
with the Antarctic winter and won.

In the Arctic, the two polar bear cubs
are now independent of their mother

and they briefly reunite
where their home ranges overlap.

Their time together will be fleeting.

Most of their lives are now spent alone,
wandering the vast tracts of frozen ocean.

Following their mother has prepared them
for life at the pole,

an ever-changing land ruled by ice.

Whether they are ready for the bigger changes

that have begun to shape the ice worlds
of our planet remains to be seen. Vast open plains.

Immense spaces.

Eerie silence.

But any feeling of emptiness is an illusion.

The plains of our planet support
the greatest gatherings of wildlife on Earth.

At the heart of all that happens here
is a single living thing.

Grass.

This miraculous plant covers
a quarter of all the lands of the Earth.

Grasslands exist wherever there is a little rain,
but not enough to sustain a forest.

Some are huge.

The Central Asian Steppe alone
extends one third of the way around our planet.

It's summer,
and eagles effortlessly cruise the thermals,

scanning the ground beneath for signs of prey.

In the distant reaches of outer Mongolia,

one of the planet's great migrations is underway.

Few people ever see
this extraordinary annual event.

Mongolian gazelle.

Two million are thought to live here,
but no one really knows.

For much of the time,
they're scattered through this vast landscape,

but once a year they come together
to have their young.

Nearly all will give birth within the next 10 days.

0ut in the open,
communal calving is the safest way to have young.

With so many pairs of eyes keeping watch,

it's almost impossible for predators to sneak up.

There are no bushes, no trees.
There's only one thing to hide behind.

Grass.

And it's not very effective.

Predators also have a hard time
raising their young on open grassland.

Without trees,
eagles have to nest directly on the ground.

All the inhabitants of the Great Plains
are exposed to the elements.

Fire sparks panic in the herd.

Gazelles are born to run

and even young calves easily outpace the flames,

if they can avoid being trampled.

With nothing to stand in its way,

the blaze consumes anything that can't flee.

Huge quantities of grass, valuable food,
have been lost.

And with it, the old and the weak.

The gazelles move on to new pastures
and leave the desolation behind them.

From the ashes rises the phoenix.

Grass, the incredible survivor.

Because it grows from a protected part
at the base of its stems,

grass is almost indestructible.

Able to repair and reproduce itself rapidly,

it covers more of the Earth's land
than any other plant

and feeds more wildlife than any other.

Red-billed quelea.

0ne and a half billion
swarm across the savannahs of Africa.

These are the most numerous birds on Earth.

Some flocks are so vast

that they can take five hours to pass overhead.

0nly grass can feed plagues of these proportions.

The ravenous hordes devour the seeds.

And the leaves and stems are cropped
by great herds of antelope.

The East African savannahs alone
sustain nearly two million wildebeest.

They trim the grass down to its roots,
leaving little in their wake,

but within days the plant will recover

and continue to sustain
the biggest herds on Earth.

Grass is not confined to the tropics.

It manages to grow
even in the bitter conditions of the Arctic.

Beyond the limits of the last tree,
the planet is barren and ice-locked.

A frozen no-man's land at the end of the Earth.

But for a short time each year,
the long, dark winter releases its grip.

Temperatures rise

and grass that has lain dormant and frozen
throughout the winter sprouts once more.

Green returns to the Arctic.

The receding ice reveals
an immense flat plain the size of Australia.

This is the Arctic tundra.

It's a desolate, silent wilderness.

But it's about to change.

Snow geese.

They winter along the Gulf of Mexico,

and in spring they fly
the entire length of North America

to reach the Arctic tundra.

Five million birds make this journey every year.

Their marathon migration
is almost 3,000 miles long

and has taken them three months.

Exhausted and starving,
they touch down inside the Arctic Circle,

back at their traditional breeding grounds at last.

Snow geese pair for life.

As soon as couples arrive,
they must stake a claim to a nesting patch.

Ideal sites are in short supply
and quarrelsome neighbours are all around.

Disputes can be vicious.

Point taken!

It's a long way to travel, but for a short period,
the tundra is the ideal place for a grazer.

The grass grows vigorously
during the short, intense summer

and there are fewer predators than further south.

Here, geese can nest on the ground
in relative safety.

Nonetheless, this female must incubate
her eggs for three weeks

and throughout this time
she will be very vulnerable.

An Arctic fox surveys the colony.

She's been waiting for the geese all winter.

Sneaking up unnoticed is impossible.

Perhaps fortune will favour the bold.

The colony is well-defended.
There are no easy pickings here.

She's driven away from every nest,
but hunger compels her to continue.

There are more eggs here
than she can possibly eat now.

But the nesting season is short.

So she stashes much of her plunder
for later in the year

when all the geese have gone.

Further south,
other bigger predators prowl the tundra.

Wolves.

For them, finding food on the plains
is an even greater challenge.

Not only is their prey seasonal,
it's also hard to find.

They've been searching for days without a sign.

Somewhere in this immense landscape
there is food for them.

This is it. Caribou.

Travelling 30 miles a day,

they can cover nearly 2,000 miles
during the summer months.

The wolves will starve
if they don't find the caribou.

But it's no easy task to locate prey
that never stops travelling.

Biting flies and the quest for new pasture
drives the migration ever onwards.

A wolf has finally picked up the trail.

The caribou are close.

At last, a chance.

The hunt is on.

The wolf panics the herd,
and the weak and young are singled out.

A calf is separated from its mother.

At the goose colony,
it's high summer and eggs are hatching.

The young all emerge within a day or two,
a marvel of timing.

The colony is now home to a million goslings.

The fox is still gathering all she can get.

Sometimes one mouth simply isn't enough.

0ne will have to do.

Not all food is stored. Some is needed right now.

She has seven hungry cubs to feed.

As their appetites grow, the mother
must work tirelessly to raise her family.

0nly fat, healthy cubs
will survive the Arctic winter.

The vast majority of the goslings
are still flourishing.

Their parents lead them
down to the safety of the water

as soon as they're strong enough
to make the journey.

For the foxes, boom time has come to an end.

But the mother has given her cubs
the best possible start in life.

The geese will continue grazing the tundra

until the summer ends
and they're forced to head south for the winter.

At these latitudes, the sun's rays are weak

and grass can only grow here
for a few months a year.

But further south,
summers are longer and the grasslands flourish.

The prairies of North America.

This rich pasture once supported
the greatest herds ever seen on our planet.

There were once 60 million bison,

but no animal is immune
to intensive hunting by man

or the destruction of its habitat.

And a century ago,
the bison were reduced to barely 1,000.

Now, thanks to rigorous protection,
the species is recovering.

The growing season is long,

and the grass here
can support herds all year round.

Male bison weigh in at one ton.

In high summer,
the bulls are fat from the rich grazing

and in prime condition, but only a few will mate.

Exactly which few is about to be decided.

0n temperate plains around the world,
summer is a time for growth and reproduction.

Now the grass produces its flowers.

New colours also come to the plains.

The northern flowering is mirrored
by the grasslands of the southern hemisphere,

and nowhere is more impressive
than on the veldt of South Africa.

Not all temperate plains
are so rich and colourful in the summer.

This is midsummer on the Tibetan plateau,

the highest great plain in the world.

Despite the conditions, grass survives

and in sufficient quantities
to support the highest of all grazing herds,

those of the wild yak.

Even in summer, life is hard.

Temperatures rarely rise above freezing
and the air is thin.

It's also exceptionally dry for one very big reason,

the Himalayas.

The great mountain range acts as a barrier,
preventing clouds moving in from the south,

and this casts a giant rain shadow
that leaves Tibet high and dry.

Grass clings to life

even as desiccating winds remove
what little moisture remains in the soil.

So long as grass can survive, so can grazers.

Wild ass.

The males are fighting to win territories.

Those that hold the best
are more likely to attract a herd of females.

It's a frisky business.

That counts as a victory,

but he can't assume
the females will actually turn up.

Female asses are mysterious creatures.

They come and go as they please

and much of their behaviour
seems unfathomable to an outsider.

They're the great nomads of the plateau

and will often trek vast distances
across these parched plains

in search of oases.

But when they do find paradise,

they are liable to feed and drink
for just a few hours

and then head back to the dust
for no apparent reason.

Wild ass are the most conspicuous pioneers
of this high frontier,

but the most numerous grazer in Tibet
lives underground.

Pika, a relative of the rabbit.
It, too, feeds on grass.

0n the exposed plateau,
pikas never stray far from their burrows.

But even so, squatters will move in
given half a chance.

While ground peckers and snow finches
can be a nuisance,

they're worth tolerating because they provide
a valuable early warning system.

The bizarre Tibetan fox. The pika's nemesis.

When stalking, it keeps below the skyline,

perhaps helped by its curious body shape.

But why the square head?

In summer, the Tibetan plateau heats up,

drawing in warm, wet air from the south.

But the water never arrives.

As the moist air approaches,
it's forced upwards by the Himalayas

and condenses into huge rain clouds.

These clouds drop all their water
on the southern side of the mountains.

The very peaks that keep Tibet dry

are responsible for the monsoon rains
falling farther south

and the greening of India.

Here, soaked by rain and bathed in tropical sun,

grass reaches its full potential.

Elephant grass is the tallest in the world.

Grass that towers over an elephant
can conceal all sorts of surprises.

The male Lesser Florican.

It's hard work getting noticed
when you go courting in high grass.

The long-grass plains of tropical India

are home to some of the largest
grass-eating mammals on our planet.

And some of the smallest.

Pygmy hogs are no bigger than rabbits.

They're the tiniest and rarest of all wild pigs.

The female is busy collecting grass,
but not for eating.

She's building a nest.

Each piglet may be small enough
to fit in the palm of a hand,

but she does have 10.

This is how grass can grow,
given unlimited sunshine and water.

But on most tropical plains across our planet,

the wet season is followed by a dry one.

0n the African savannahs,

grazers are marching in search of grass and water.

Without rain, these plains can become dust bowls.

Grass can now lose its hold.

Elephants are in immediate danger.

They must drink almost daily.

Driven on by thirst,

they march hundreds of miles
across the parched plains.

Relying on memory,
the matriarchs lead their families

to those special water holes
that saved them in previous years.

This one still has water,
but they must share what remains

with desperately thirsty animals of all kinds.

These are tense times.

The elephants dominate the water hole,

but as night falls the balance of power will shift.

Thirsty herds continue to arrive
throughout the night.

It's a cooler time to travel.

In the darkness, the tables turn.

The elephant's night vision
is little better than our own.

But lions have much more sensitive eyes.

The cats are hungry
and the elephants seem to sense it.

Lions don't usually hunt elephants,

but desperate times require desperate measures.

This herd contains calves, easier targets.

But how to reach them?

The adults encircle their young.

It's an impenetrable wall of grey.

A few exhausted stragglers are still arriving.

0ne of them is alone.

But it's too big for the lions to tackle.

This one looks a little smaller.

A solitary lion stands no chance,

but the whole pride is here.

There are 30 of them
and they are specialist elephant hunters.

This elephant will feed the whole pride
for at least a week.

Elephants know
these drinking holes are dangerous,

but they have no choice.

The dramas that play out here
are a savage reminder

of how important water is
for all life on these plains.

As the dry season finally draws to a close,

Africa's baked savannahs
undergo a radical change.

Rain sweeps across the continent

and grass, the great survivor, rises again.

And the herds return.

For months they've been scattered
over huge areas,

clinging to existence around tiny water holes.

Now, the good times are back.

A few African savannahs are very special.

Here, rainwater from far and wide
flows across the flat plains.

Grass is submerged, but still it grows.

Flooded, burnt, baked and frozen,
grass can withstand it all.

After six months of drought,

grass replaces dust over great areas.

Fresh new shoots draw animals
from great distances.

Many undertake epic migrations
to catch the boom time.

Some resourceful animals live here
all the year round.

Baboons are permanent residents,
but they have to change their behaviour

if they are to gather what they need
on the newly flooded plains.

There's plenty to eat,

but getting to it can be a little uncomfortable.

New water poses problems for the youngsters,

but they know where to find a dry seat.

Ajuicy snail is ample recompense
for sodden paws.

Having survived the dry, barren times,

animals can now reap the rewards.

0n this seasonal planet,

the great plains are lands of feast and famine.

At their peak, they support the greatest
gatherings of wildlife found anywhere on Earth. The coast - the frontier
between land and sea.

This is the most dynamic
of all the ocean habitats.

The challenge here is
to survive change.

Extreme change.

Cape Douglas, on the most
westerly of the Galapagos islands,

totally unprotected from the massive
rollers of the Pacific Ocean

and one of the roughest
coastlines in the world.

The marine iguanas of the Galapagos
are the world's only sea-going lizards.

Seaweed is all they eat,
but doing so is a dangerous business.

The local crabs have
become specially flattened,

minimising the effect
of the pounding waves.

And the iguanas have huge
claws to grip the rocks.

This seaweed really is fast food.

There are only a few seconds
in which to grab a few mouthfuls

before the next breaker
comes pounding in.

Female iguanas feed
only on the exposed rocks,

but the males which are larger swim and
dive beneath the surface to reach the weed.

They go as deep as ten metres,

for there beyond the destructive reach
of the waves, they find the best fronds.

Being cold-blooded they
have to return to land

after about ten minutes or
so to warm up again in the sun.

Finding food is not the only
challenge for coastal residents.

These rocky shores are hardly
a safe place to lay their eggs

and each year the marine iguanas
have to journey inland

to find a more suitable one.

The females lay their eggs in burrows
and leave them there to hatch,

and to do that they
need nice soft sand.

Down at the water edge, it was easy
to escape danger in rocky crevices,

but up here the females
are dangerously exposed.

A Galapagos hawk.

The lizards don't give up
without a struggle.

These hawks stay on the coast all year
But they are exceptional.

The majority of the birds
that frequent this frontier

spend most of their time elsewhere.
In or above the open ocean.

However all seabirds have to come
to land in order to lay their eggs.

And after spending many lonely
months searching the ocean for food,

they have to re-establish
their social relationships.

Frigate birds display and
exchange nesting material.

Waved albatross dance.

The need to lay their egg on firm ground
ties the albatross to the coast

but parental responsibilities
are shared.

While one looks after the egg,
...the other can go off to feed.

The need to breed brings
many different animals

to the coast each year
for a few weeks.

Male sea turtles spend all
their lives at sea, but the females,

like birds, must come to
land to lay their eggs.

To do that green turtles that live
and feed off the coast of Brazil

swim fifteen hundred miles to the
tiny island of Ascension

that lies bang in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean.

Exactly how they manage to
navigate with such accuracy

and find this tiny lump of rock,
just seven miles wide is a mystery.

But each year up to five thousand
turtles manage to do so and then,

close to the coast of Ascension,
they mate.

Travelling to and from Ascension and
nesting here can take up to six months

and throughout that entire time,
none of them feed at all.

After mating a female has to
leave her natural element

and haul herself up onto land.

She does so at night,
laying about three or four times

at around fifteen day intervals.

After that she then swims all the way
back to the seas off Brazil.

She returns to this very same
island throughout her life.

Remarkably, all the world's sea turtles
return year after year

to just a few traditional
breeding sites.

Crab Island, in Australia,
is one of them.

This tiny two-mile long crescent of sand,

lying a few miles off
Queensland's northerly tip,

provides nesting sites
for half the entire population

of one of the world's
rarest sea turtles.

Flat-backed turtles are large,
over a metre long

but they have to be careful.

There are other giant
reptiles here too.

Salt-water crocodiles.

Every night throughout the year

there are flat-backs burying their eggs
all along this lonely stretch of sand.

Nine weeks later and things
are about to happen.

These eyes shining in the darkness
belong to night herons.

As if from nowhere, hundreds of birds
suddenly appear on the sand dunes.

Pelicans wait patiently.

Jabiru storks pace up and down.

Before long they see what
they've been waiting for.

Because these turtles lay
their eggs throughout the year,

the hatchlings emerge night after night
in a steady trickle of beak sized meals.

Pelican's broad beaks allow
them to dig out the hatchlings

before the herons can spear
them on the surface.

The surf may be hundreds of metres away

and at least a third of the tiny turtles
do not survive the journey.

And its not just the birds
that take them.

Crocodiles, sharks and hungry fish
are all waiting in the shallows.

In fact only one in every hundred
hatchlings will survive to adulthood.

Another beach, another continent,
and a very special night.

Here in Costa Rica there is a turtle which
has found a way of reducing these dangers.

When Ridley's turtles arrive
to lay their eggs

they don't come in tens or hundreds...
but in thousands.

Over the next six days around four hundred
thousand females will visit this beach.

At the peak time, five thousand
are coming and going each hour.

The beach gets so crowded that
they have to clamber over one another

to find a bare patch of sand
where they can dig a nest hole.

Forty million eggs are laid
in these few days.

So these turtles ensure
that six weeks later

when their hatchlings emerge
it's not just a trickle.

It's a flood.

On some nights, over two million
hatchlings race down to the sea together.

With so many appearing simultaneously,

the predators are overwhelmed and most
of the young turtles reach the sea safely.

Leaving the sea and emerging onto
land is hard enough for turtles.

It'd even harder for fish.

Each year for hundreds of miles
along the Newfoundland coast,

capelin throw themselves
onto the beaches.

At least a million tonnes of
fish floundering out of the water

a real gift for scavenging
eagles and gulls.

Odd though it may seem for a fish,
these capelin,

like the turtles, have also
come out of the sea to breed.

The males are trying to
fertilise the eggs

that the females are
depositing in the sand.

Like the Ridley's turtles,

they have synchronised their mass
laying with the tide.

In a few days it will be over.

Most of the capelin die but only after
they've left their eggs in the sand.

Other capelin populations
lay their eggs

in the ocean so why do the
Newfoundland fish spawn on land.

It seems that eggs deposited in
the beach may be safer

from predators and develop faster
than in colder waters out to sea.

But wherever they do so,
the huge spawning shoals

provide the concentration of food that
seabirds need when they assemble to breed.

Ninety five percent of the
world's seabirds nest together,

mostly in large spectacular colonies.

This is Funk Island forty miles
off the coast of Newfoundland

an isolated rock crammed
with breeding sea-birds.

This was the last breeding ground for the
flightless Great Auk, sadly now extinct.

Today it's still the world's
largest Guillemot colony.

Over a million of them share the
crowded island with 250,000 gannets.

It's not the lack of suitable sites

that causes the seabirds
to breed in such densities.

Here in the North Atlantic,
there's a wide choice of

empty coastline that
the birds could use.

The key factor limiting the size
and location of seabird colonies

seems to be the availability of food
in the surrounding ocean.

There are lots of hungry mouths to feed
and a constant demand for fish.

Throughout the long summer days
at colonies like funk,

There's a continual stream of birds,
heading out to the ocean to find food

and returning with full crops
to feed their young.

Gannets will travel up
to two hundred miles

from the colony on
a single foraging trip.

They are not fussy eaters
and will take everything

from tiny sand eels to herring.

Puffins, on the other hand,
are very particular about

what they eat and because they can
only fly short distances,

they only nest where there's a good
supply of suitable food close by.

One such place is the sea of Okhotsk
in far eastern Russia.

This is the island of Talan.

Throughout the long arctic winter,
it is encircled by ice.

But as spring approaches,
that begins to break up

and seabirds that have spent
the winter feeding out

on the open ocean far to
the south begin to return.

Its isolated position and steep cliffs
make Talan a perfect nesting site.

The Tufted Puffins arrive first.

These are the Pacific cousins of
our less spectacular Atlantic species.

Horned puffins soon follow.

In all, fourteen different species
return to Talan each spring

and in just a few weeks
the once silent cliffs

come alive to the calls of
4 million breeding seabirds.

This is a multi-storey avian city.

Assembling in these dense colonies after
having spent a largely solitary life

at sea provides the birds with
the social stimulation

that is the key to co-ordinating
their breeding.

By nesting and laying together
they ensure that

most of their chicks will leave
the nest at exactly the same time.

Just like the turtles this is the way
they spread the impact of predators.

The world's largest eagle.
Steller's sea eagle.

A third as big again as a golden.

Throughout the summer, the eagles
hunt in Talan's crowded colonies.

Riding on the updrafts,
they patrol the top of the cliffs,

looking out for any Kittiwake
that ventures too far from the rock face.

Suddenly the huge eagle stoops
with the aerial agility of a falcon.

Co-ordinated panic among the kittiwakes
confuses their attacker.

But the eagle doesn't give up.

And it has got one.

Another kind of seabird on Talan
has a particularly effective way

of defending itself against predators

but it doesn't appear until
an hour before sunset.

As if from nowhere, dense swarms of
seabirds suddenly arrive off-shore.

They're spent the day feeding far away,
where the sea ice has already broken up.

They are crested auklets,
hardly bigger than starlings.

A million of them return to Talan each
year to nest in its fields of boulders.

For an hour before sunset,
the hillsides comes alive

with huge flocks of circling auklets
They're nervous.

No one wants to be the first to land.

Auklets are very social when
they are back together at the coast.

One of the advantages of nesting
in such densities

may be the chance to share
information on good feeding sites.

It also gives them the
opportunity to court.

But perhaps most importantly,
there is safety in numbers.

Ravens and peregrines circle above
the scree slope every evening.

By taking off together,
the auklets hope to confuse the predators.

Eventually their persistence
pays off.

The birds that face the
greatest challenge in coming

to the coast to nest are
surely the penguins.

Unable to fly, they have no alternative
but to brave the immense waves.

Most penguins live in the southern ocean

and they have to accept being
hurled about by the surf.

Whatever the weather, the penguin parents
have to come back to feed their chicks.

A southern sea lion bull

he knows the penguins always use
the same traditional landing beach.

Having braved the thundering surf,

the penguins have to make a mad dash
across open rock to get to their nests.

Despite his massive size and
a body adapted for swimming,

the bull chases the penguins for forty
or fifty metres across the rocks.

Having caught his penguin, the sea lion
carries it out into deeper water where,

by violently thrashing the little body,
he skins his meal.

The seas around the Falklands are some
of the roughest in the world.

In spite of that, the southern ocean
is home to millions of tiny seabirds

hardly bigger than swallows-petrels.

Being so small they are very
vulnerable to the bad weather.

A severe storm can blow
them miles off course

and keep them away from
their nests for days.

But these birds have developed a very
effective solution to that problem.

They lay a rather special egg.

Most bird's eggs, left exposed for even
a few hours, will chill and never hatch.

But these eggs are different.

They can be left for several days
without incubation and remain undamaged...

...while the parents struggle
home through the storm.

Prions have also come up with
a good way to avoid most predators.

They never come back to the
coast until after dark.

These are Thin-billed Prions.

Their burrows honeycomb this
hillside in the Falklands.

It'd deserted throughout
the daylight hours...

...but as soon as it's dark

and difficult for airborne
predators to hunt...

...the prions return.

As soon as they land, they call.

The problem, of course...

...is finding your burrow
among all the others.

He's listening out for
his mate's call...

...and down he goes.

The Alaskan coast.

It's spring and the last of
the winter storms is subsiding.

The plankton in this sea is in
bloom again and just off shore,

humpback whales have
returned to feed.

For these huge animals, there is a real
risk in coming into such shallow water

and each year a good number
of them pay the price.

It is an ignominious ending
for an ageing whale.

But so much flesh will not go to waste.

A black bear emerges
cautiously from the woods.

Visitors to the coast that don't come to
breed, have usually come to scavenge.

A whole range of different animals
have learnt to exploit

the enormous quantity of food...

...that washes up everyday on
coastlines around the world.

But like so much at the coast
the quantity of flotsam

and jetsam is unpredictable.

Nobody can rely on it alone.

This carcass even attracted
a shy pack of wolves only too happy

to anoint themselves with the...

...scent of rotting whale.

It was months before the
scavengers finally

cleaned up all the meat
on this huge and...

...unpredictable gift from the sea.

Whales give birth to their young at sea
and so can spend their entire lives there.

Other marine mammals - one of that are
in fact distant cousins of bears

have to return... each year to
their ancestral home on land.

The high arctic
Here lives one of them... the walrus.

Walruses spend nearly
all their lives at sea,

but each year for just a few weeks...

...they have to return to the coast.

They seek out isolated beaches
like this one on Round Island in the...

...far northern Pacific.

Suitable sites like this,
free from bears, are so scarce...

...that at times as many as
fourteen thousand animals

will cram themselves on to this...

...one beach.

When they first emerge from
the sea the walrus are white.

That's because being warm-blooded
animals living in very cold ocean,

they conserve heat by...

...keeping their blood concentrated
in the core of their bodies.

On land it's warm enough for them
to allow their...

...outer blood vessels to dilate and
that turns their skin from white to pink.

Now they can moult the outer
layers of their skin,

rubbing themselves up
against the rocks.

But more than anything
else coming to land

brings the walrus relief
from having to spend energy

maintaining their body temperature
in an icy-cold ocean.

Heat conservation, in fact, may well
be the primary reason so many...

...sea mammals are forced to
return to the land each year.

The world's coldest seas
are in Antarctica.

Each spring, half the world's
Southern Elephant seals

return to the island
of South Georgia.

Elephant seals have particularly thick
insulation of blubber that keeps them warm.

For them breeding is the only
reason to leave the sea.

With temperatures down
to minus 20...

...and hundred mile an hour winds,
it can't be comfortable out on the beach,

but heat dissipates more
rapidly through water...

...than through air so even
in these conditions...

...their young which at first
don't have a thick coat

of blubber will be far
warmer on the land.

Once the males are established on the
beach the females soon follow.

Within just ten days the empty beach
fills up with six thousand elephant seals.

Almost immediately the females give
birth to pups sired the previous year.

Their milk is very rich and the pups
grow astonishingly quickly.

In just three weeks they turn form thin
bags of skin to fat balls of blubber.

As soon as they've given birth,

the females become sexually
receptive again...

...and it's now that the
advantages of breeding

in such dense colonies become clear.

Females can make their
choice from many males,

while successful males can
have access to lots of females.

But to gain that access and
control a harem of females,

the bull must be prepared to fight.

The larger the male, the louder the roar
and the more likely he is to win.

When males are well matched these bloody
battles will last twenty minutes or more.

Eventually, the loser retreats into
a stream already pink with his own blood.

These battles certainly help females
select the strongest bulls...

...but they bring great
dangers for the pups.

Each year, in the denser
parts of the colony,

a fifth of the pups are
crushed to death.

This is why it may
be better to mate

at the edge of the beach
close to the sea.

Less dominant males hide
in the surf.

They are waiting to try
and steal an illicit mating...

...with females as
they come and go.

This male knows he has been
spotted by the big bull

who claims all the females
on this part of the beach.

Breeding in groups can bring advantages
to pups as well as to adults.

Along the coast of Patagonia southern sea
lions breed together each year

in groups several hundred strong.

For the growing pups these colonies
act rather like a school.

The bonds and relationships
developed here on the beach

may be vital for the
rest of their lives.

Sea lions are very social animals
and as adults and young forage together,

they probably share...

...information about the location
of good feeding sites.

Conditions here could hardly be better
for the growing youngsters.

As the tide goes out it leaves behind
a selection of sheltered pools.

Perfect places for
learning to swim.

At high tide...

...it is easy for the pups to take their
first experimental dips in the surf.

A killer whale.

These young pups have never seen
anything like it before.

The Whales though are
very experienced.

Each year this same group turns
up along the coast

at precisely the same time
as the pups are starting to swim.

The whales need to surprise the pups,

so they have stopped calling
to one another and keep silent.

Speed is everything.

The whales do not take pups
that are out of the water,

but sometimes their momentum
drives them right up the beach

and then there's real danger
of getting stuck.

The whale has to thrash in this
frenzied way to get off the beach.

Most of the pups are taken into deep
water while they're still alive.

And there the whales - apparently.
Play with them.

Often an adult whale is joined
in the game by a youngster.

It may be learning how to grab a seal pup
before it risks a drive up the beach.

Whatever the reason the seal pup.
Still alive

is tossed back and forth
for over half an hour.

Even when the pup is dead, the whales'
sport is not completely over.

We can only speculate at the real reasons
behind this extraordinary behaviour.

But for the whales, the hunting
season is a short one.

Before long the pups learn to
stay well clear of the water

and the whales become less
and less successful.

After just two weeks, they move on.

The killing season is over.

That's how it often happens
along the coast.

Things are always changing.

They're never the same
for long in this,

the most dynamic of all
the ocean's habitats. Away from all land

the ocean.

It covers more than half the surface
of our planet

and yet for the most part
it is beyond our reach.

Much of it is virtually empty

a watery desert.

All life that is here
is locked in a constant search to find food

a struggle to conserve precious energy

in the open ocean.

The biggest of all fish

thirty tons in weight,
twelve meters long

a whale shark.

It's huge bulk is sustained by
mere microscopic creatures of the sea

Plankton.

Whale sharks cruise on regular habitual routes

between the best feeding grounds.

In February,
that takes them to the surface waters

far from the coast of Venezuela.

Others are already here.

Baitfish have come for the same reason
to feed on the plankton.

The whale shark has timed it's arrival
exactly right.

Oddly, the tiny fish swarm around it.

They're using it as a shield.

Other predatory fish are lurking nearby.

Yellowfin tuna.
They seem wary of the giant.

The shark dives,
as if to escape from such overcrowding.

Now the tuna have a chance
to attack the unprotected baitfish

but then

back comes the giant.

It has taken a vast mouthful
of the baitfish itself.

Plankton, it seems,
is not the only food for a whale shark.

Both shark and tuna feast together

but the tuna must be wary.

Even they can end up
in the whale shark's stomach.

Predators here must grab
what they can, when they can

for such events do not last long.

The dense shoals, on which so many depend

gather only when water conditions are perfect.

Many predators spend much of their time
cruising the open ocean

endlessly searching.

Plankton feeding rays do so,
gliding with minimum effort.

The oceanic whitetip shark

another energy efficient traveler.

It specializes in locating prey
in the emptiest areas of the open ocean

patrolling the top one hundred meters of water.

Taste in water,
is the equivalent of smell in the air.

An oceanic whitetip is able to detect
even the faintest trace.

Small pilot fish swim with it.

The shark can find prey
far more easily than they can

and they'll be able to collect the scraps
from it's meals.

It's long, fixed pectoral fins

enable it to soar through the water,
with the least expenditure of energy.

This shark has found a school
of rainbow runners.

It would eat one, given the chance

but rainbow runners are swift and agile
and not easily caught

so, it bides it's time.

There's a chance that, eventually,
it may spot a weakened fish that's catchable.

The hunter

endlessly waiting.

Excitement far from land.

A school of dolphin
five hundred strong.

They've sensed there's food around,
and they're racing to catch up with it.

The news has spread.
Now a number of schools are on their way.

They're heading towards the Azores

volcanic islands
a thousand miles west of Portugal.

The dolphin scan the water ahead
with their sonar.

They're close to their target.

This is it.

Scad mackerel.

It's difficult for a single dolphin
to catch the fish.

To avoid wasting energy
the work as a group.

They drive the fish upwards,
trapping them against the surface

and there,
other predators await them.

Cory's shearwaters.

They're waiting for the dolphin
to drive the prey closer to the surface.

Now the shearwaters can dive down on them,
descending to twenty meters or more

and the dolphins block the baitball's retreat.

The dolphins leave
as soon as they've had their fill

and, at last, the mackerel sink below
the diving range of the birds.

As the Sun disappears,
a profound change takes place in the ocean.

Deep water plankton
start to rise from the depths

and another hungry army
prepares to receive it.

Every night,
wherever conditions are right,

countless millions of creatures from the deep
migrate to the surface, seeking food.

A baby sailfish,
fifteen centimeters long

snaps up everything in it's path.

In three years' time, it'll be one of the oceans
most formidable hunters

weighing sixty kilos.

Just now, however,
it's very vulnerable.

These manta rays are giants.

Eight meters across
and weighing over two tons.

The blade-like projections on either side of the head
help to steer plankton into the manta's mouth.

Dawn returns, and the plankton
sinks back into the depths.

If we are to follow,
we must use a submarine.

As we descend into the darkness,
the pressure builds, the temperature falls.

Below five hundred meters,
new, mysterious animals appear.

Their bizarre shapes help them
to remain suspended in the dark space.

Some resemble creatures
familiar from shallower waters

others defy classification.

All around, organic particles
drift downwards.

Marine snow, detritus from the creatures
swarming in the sunlit waters above.

The snow is food for many animals here,
like the sea spider

a small relative of shrimps and crabs.

Those strange leg-like appendages
are feathered, to stop it from sinking.

They can also enmesh marine snow

which it wipes carefully
into it's jaws.

A sawtooth eel
hangs upright and motionless.

Gazing ever upwards, it watches
for prey, silhouetted against the faint

glimmerings of light from the surface.

Days may pass before prey swims
close enough for it to strike.

Farther down still,
the blackness is complete.

No vestige of sunlight
can penetrate as far as this.

Food is very scarce and nothing
can afford to waste any energy.

A dumbo octopus simply flaps a fin

no need for the jet propulsion
used by it's shallow water relatives above.

The weirdest, in this world of the strange,
vampyroteuthis

the vampire squid from hell.

Disturb it and it only retreats
a little distance.

Go after it,
and it has a special defense.

To see what it does,
you must switch off the lights.

The vampire squid
has lights of it's own.

Bioluminescent bacteria
shine from pockets on it's arms
to confuse it's predators.

Are those eyes?

In fact they're spots
at the end of it's mantle.

A bite there,
would leave the head unscathed.

The threat diminishes, and vampyroteuthis
disappears into the blackness.

At last,
the sea floor.

Over two miles down, the pressure here
is three hundred times that at the surface.

It takes several months for marine snow
to drift down as far as this.

As you travel away
from the rocky margins of the continents

an immense plain stretches ahead.

It extends for thousands of miles

gradually sinking downwards.

There are faint trails in the ooze,
signs that even here there is life.

These are what made some of them

sea urchins sifting the accumulating drifts.

Shrimps standing on elegant tiptoe

fastidiously select the particles
that appeal to them

but, in the deep sea, as everywhere else
if there are grazers, there are hunters.

A monkfish, almost indistinguishable
from the sand on which it lies.

Why waste energy chasing around,
if you can attract prey towards you with a lure?

Maybe that one was a bit big.

The monkfish can wait, for days if necessary,
until the right sized meal turns up.

Scavengers on the other hand,
have to move around to find their food.

Crabs can detect
the faintest of tastes in the water

and that helps them locate the latest body
to drift down from above.

Eels are already feeding on the corpse.

Isopods, like giant marine woodlice
a third of a meter long

are ripping into the rotting flesh.

Over the next few hours
there'll be frenzied competition

between scavengers of all kinds
to grab a share.

Just occasionally,
there is a gigantic bonanza.

The remains of a sperm whale.

It died five months or so ago.

There's little left but fatty blubber
clinging to it's bones.

It's flesh has nourished life
for miles around

but now the feast is almost over.

Spider crabs, a meter across,
still pick at the last putrid remains.

A few weeks more, and nothing
will be left, but bare bones.

The crabs will have to fast,
until the next carcass drifts down.

But not all food
comes from the sunlit world above.

The floor of the Atlantic Ocean is split in two
by an immense volcanic mountain chain

that winds unbroken
for forty five thousand miles around the globe.

In places, it's riven by great fissures,
from which superheated water

loaded with dissolved minerals
blasts into the icy depths.

Clouds of sulfides solidify into
towering chimneys, as tall as a three story house.

At four hundred degrees
this scalding cocktail of chemicals

would be lethally toxic
to most forms of life

but astoundingly, a particular kind
of bacteria thrives here

and feeding on the bacteria,
vast numbers of shrimps.

So, beyond the farthest reach
of the Sun's power

a rich independent community exists,
that draws all it's energy

directly from the Earth's molten core.

On the other side of the planet,
in the western Pacific bordering Japan

the dragon chimneys, another series
of hot vents, erupting in the darkness.

Here, more, but different bacteria
thrive in a similar way.

And here, too, more crustaceans,
but quite different species

from those around the hot vents
in the Atlantic.

These are squat lobsters,
clad in furry armor

jostling with one another
beside the jets of superheated water

for the best places,
from which to graze on bacteria.

These vents, too, like those in the Atlantic
are isolated oases

so widely separated,
that each community is unique.

Cross to the other side of the Pacific,
to the deep near the Galapagos Islands

and there are yet other fissures venting
superheated water.

One and a half miles down,
at a site known as Nine North

towering chimneys support
a spectacular display of giant tubeworms.

These vents
give off so much energy

that some of the worms reach
three meters in length.

They're the fastest growing
marine invertebrates known.

All told, over fifty different species
have so far been found living here.

The inhabitants of these bustling communities
may grow at speed

but their existence can also be short,
for the vents do not erupt indefinitely.

Suddenly, unpredictably,
they may become inactive.

Nine months have passed at Nine North.

What were only recently chimneys
teeming with life

have turned into cold,
sterile mineral monuments.

Some eddy, deep in the Earth's crust

diverted the volcanic energy elsewhere

and, an entire microworld was extinguished.

In places, volcanoes have erupted to build
great submarine mountains.

There are thought to be around
thirty thousand such volcanoes

some, measured from the sea floor,
are taller than Everest.

Sheer cliffs
soaring to drowned volcanic peaks.

Powerful currents
sweep up the mountains' flanks

transporting nutrients from deep water
towards the summits.

The hard rock provides excellent anchorage

for communities of great variety
and stunning color.

Soft corals, several meters across
collect the marine snow as it drifts past.

Whip corals stretch out into the current.

Giant sponges filter nourishment
from the cold water.

A richly varied community flourishes here

sustained by the nutrients and detritus
in the icy currents that flow around the peak.

Yet it is all blossoming
on an extinct volcano

a mile below the reach of the Sun.

A nautilus. It spends it's days
hiding four hundred meters down

But as night falls, it ascends
up to the reefs, to look for food.

It's graceful shell contains gas filled
floatation chambers, that control it's depth.

It's powered by a jet of water,
squirting from a siphon

but it travels shell first,
so it can't see exactly where it's going.

It's nearest living relatives
are squid and octopus

which, over evolutionary time,
have both lost their shells

and the octopus has become
one of the nautilus' major predators.

It's a master of disguise.

The nautilus keeps well clear of them.

It's small tentacles carry
highly developed chemical sensors

which can detect traces
of both predators and prey.

It uses it's water jet
to dig in the sand.

Because it devotes so little energy to swimming,
it only needs a meal once a month.

Got something. And just as well.
Dawn is approaching and it has to puff it's way

back, to deeper waters.

Thirty miles away, shoals of squid
are jetting upwards towards the surface.

By night, they seek small fish
among the plankton, but they're cautious.

Pacific spotted dolphin.

They're guided by their sonar.

The dolphin, as so often, are working
as a team, synchronizing their attacks

to confuse their prey.

As dawn approaches, squid and fish and plankton
retreat downwards, to shelter in the darkness.

Some of these isolated volcanoes

rise as much as nine thousand meters
from the sea floor, reaching close to the surface.

Around these peaks
invigorated by daily sunshine

marine life flourishes
in spectacular abundance.

Fish crowd here, because the volcano
forces nutrients to the surface

encouraging the plankton to bloom.

An oceanic wanderer,
a mola mola

stops by to be cleaned by reef fish,
at the sea mount edge.

Butterfly-fish pluck string-like parasites
from it's flanks.

The huge fish lives on jellyfish
over a thousand meters down

where the water is twenty degrees colder

so, a brushup near the surface,
allows it to warm up

before making more deep water forays.

The summit of this volcanic mountain
rises above the surface of the sea.

It's Ascension Island

eight hundred miles from any other land,
a welcome vital haven for long distance travelers.

Frigatebirds spend months
continuously airborne at sea

but at nesting time, they come to Ascension
from all over the ocean.

The island's barren slopes
of volcanic ash and lava

might seem to offer
perfectly good sites for a nest

but the frigates choose
an even more isolated site

Boatswain Bird Island,
a lonely pillar, just of Ascension's coast.

Frigates are the world's lightest bird,
relative to their wingspan

and they can soar for weeks on end
with minimal effort.

They seem much more at home in the skies,
than in a crowded colony on land

but nest, they must.

They come from all over the Atlantic
to this, their only colony.

There are boobys here, too.

To raise their young,
seabirds worldwide seek such remote islands.

Swimmers also come to Ascension to breed.

A female green turtle
approaches the coast.

She's not eaten once, in two months.

She may have traveled one thousand miles
from her feeding grounds

the greatest journey of her kind.

Many others are here, too,
resting on the sandy sea floor

awaiting the darkness of night,
when it'll be safer to visit the beaches.

Eggs that were laid a few weeks ago,
at the start of the season

are beginning to hatch.

Most hatchings happen at night.

Now, in the light of day,
the young are extremely vulnerable.

They must get to the sea as soon as possible

but their trials have only just begun.

Many will drown
in the pounding waves.

During the next twenty years,
the vast majority will inevitably die

but those that survive will, eventually,
as their mothers did before them,

return to the very same beach
where they were hatched.

How they find their way back

across thousands of miles of open ocean,
we still have no idea.

A frigate soars.

Somewhere, beneath the surface below,

there is the food it must have.

But where?

Those that fly above the ocean

must be able to read the signs
of fresh supplies, or perish.

A hundred miles from the Mexican coast,
and keen eyes have spotted movement.

Sailfish, three meters long,
are closing in on prey.

They will only use
just enough energy to make their kill

never wasting a fin stroke.

Nearly a hundred sailfish have surrounded
a single school of baitfish.

It's very rare to see so many
of these hunters in one place.

To herd their prey,
the predators raise their huge dorsal fins.

A mistimed strike by one sailfish,
could fatally damage another

but each continually changes it's color,
from blue, to striped, to black

that warns it's companions of it's intentions
and also confuses the prey.

As the shoal is driven nearer the surface,
it comes within the range of the seabirds.

Out here, in the open ocean,
there is nowhere for the baitfish to hide.

Sailfish live a high octane life.

To survive, they must find prey daily

so their entire existence will be spent
on the move.

Over ninety percent on the living space
for life on our planet, is in the oceans

Home to the biggest animal that exists

or has ever existed.

the blue whale.

Some weigh nearly two hundred tons

twice the size of the largest dinosaur.

Despite their great size, we still have little idea
of where they travel in the vast oceans

and none at all
of where they go to breed.

The largest animal on Earth
feeds almost exclusively

on one of the smallest
krill, shrimp-like crustaceans.

They take many tons of water into their
ballooning throats in a single gulp

and sieve out what it contains.

Every day, each one swallows
some four million krill.

Such gargantuan harvests depend
on the continuing fertility of the oceans

But global changes now threaten
the great blooms of plankton

on which the whales depend.

Once and not so long ago

three hundred thousand blue whales
roamed the oceans

now, less than three percent
of that number remains.

Our planet is still full of wonders.

As we explore them, so we gain
not only understanding, but power.

It's not just the future of the whale
that today lies in our hands

it's the survival of the natural world
in all parts of the living planet.

We can now destroy,
or we can cherish.

The choice is ours. When you look
down on the Earth's surface,

it's impossible not to be impressed

by the sheer grandeur,
splendour and power

of the natural world.

It's been ten years
since we explored these wonders

in the first series of Manet Earth.

And since then, much has changed.

We can now show life on our planet

in entirely new ways,

bring you closer to animals
than ever before,

and reveal new wildlife dramas
for the very first time.

But that is not all.

The planet has changed, too.

Never have our wildernesses
been as fragile

and as precious as they are today.

At this crucial time
for the natural world,

we will journey to every corner
of the globe

to explore the greatest treasures
of our living planet,

and reveal the extreme lengths
animals go to to survive.

Finally, we will explore our cities

to see how life is adapting
to the newest habitat on Earth.

This is Planet Earth II.

There are hundreds
of thousands of islands,

each one a world in miniature.

A microcosm of our living planet.

The struggles to survive
on these remote lands

reflect the challenges
faced by all life on Earth.

The tiny island of Escudo
off the coast of Panama,

home to the pygmy three-teed sloth.

This is a male,
and life here suits him well.

Mangroves provide all the leaves
he can eat

and there are no predators to worry him.

Island life may seem idyllic,

but it comes at a price.

There are only a few hundred
pygmy sloths in existence,

and he needs a mate.

RILL CALL)

That's an enticing call...

...from a female

somewhere out there.

And this, for a sloth,
is a quick reaction.

The problem is there's deep water
between them.

So what should any red-blooded sloth do?

Swim, of course.

Could this be her?

He does his best to put on
a turn of speed.

But she's not the one.

She already has a baby

and she won't mate again
until it leaves her

in about six months' time.

Even life on a paradise island
can have its limitations.

But at least she can't be far away.

The world's entire population
of pygmy sloths

is isolated on a speck of land no bigger
than New York's Central Park.

The size of an island
has a huge influence

on the fate of those cast away there.

The island of Komodo in Indonesia.

Home to dragons.

Three metres long and weighing
a massive 70 kilos,

these are the largest living lizards
on the planet.

It's unusual to find large predators
on islands.

Yet, for four million years,
the Komodo dragon has dominated here.

It might seem there wouldn't be
enough food

to support such giants
on this relatively small island,

but reptiles, being cold-blooded,

need only about a tenth of the food
a carnivorous mammal would.

A single meal
will last a dragon a month.

They're so successful,
that their only serious competition

comes from others of their own kind,

and there are some 2,000 of them here.

This giant, however,
isn't looking for food.

He's looking for a mate.

Female dragons come into season
only once a year.

She is receptive.

So far, so good.

But he strayed
into someone else's patch.

Another huge male
thinks he is the king here.

Space being limited on islands,
dragon territories overlap,

and that creates continual conflict.

In dragon society, size is everything.

But if rivals are closely matched,
the outcome can be uncertain.

Muscular tails strike with
the power of sledgehammers.

And their serrated teeth
are as sharp as steak knives.

Each tries to topple his opponent.

Defeated.

Only the most powerful dragons
win the right to mate.

The limited food and space
on the small islands

can often lead to intense competition.

But some islands are immense.

More like miniature continents.

And these provide opportunities
for life to experiment and evolve.

Madagascar is one of
the biggest islands

and also one of the oldest,

having split away from Africa over
120 million years ago.

With time and isolation,
its animals have adapted

to take advantage
of every available niche.

The island now has some
250,000 different species,

most found nowhere else on Earth.

These are not monkeys, but lemurs.

From a single ancestor, about a hundred
different types have evolved.

The largest, the Indri,
seldom comes down from the branches.

The much smaller ring-tails
wander in troops across the forest floor

searching for fruit.

And tiny bamboo lemurs eat nothing
except bamboo.

With few competitors,

lemurs have been free to colonise almost
every environment on the island,

even the most extreme.

This baby sifaka
has a hard life ahead of it.

He's been born in the most arid
and hostile corner

of Madagascar's vast landscape.

If he is to survive here,
he has much to learn.

The spiny forest is like a desert.

It rarely rains, so water and food
is very hard to find.

Moving from tree to tree
is a perilous business.

Here, nearly all the plants
are covered with ferocious spines.

His mother searches the treetops
for the youngest leaves.

They provide the only food and water
to sustain the family.

At three months old,
the youngster is starting to explore.

All too soon, he will have to fend
for himself up here.

But it's altogether easier
to stay on Mother's back.

If he can master the strange ways
of this forest,

he will have a little corner
of Madagascar to himself.

Island life encourages animals
to do things differently,

and on some islands, that is essential.

There are islands still forming today

built by volcanoes.

Some erupt explosively,

others pour out rivers of molten rock,

lava.

In the last 50 years,

ten new volcanic islands
have been formed.

Newly created and often remote,
they're hard for colonists to reach.

Even those that do, find these
are tough places to survive.

This is Fernandina,

one of the Galapagos Islands
in the Pacific.

Young and still volcanically active,
it's a desolate place.

The surrounding sea, however,
is particularly rich with life,

and the frontier between these
two very different worlds

is the home of one of the strangest
of reptiles,

sea-going iguanas.

They are vegetarians,

but since there's little food for them
on the land,

marine iguanas graze on the sea floor.

A big male like this one
can dive to 30 metres

and hold his breath for half an hour.

There are more than 7,000 individuals
on Fernandina alone.

And by bringing nutrients from the sea
to the land,

the iguanas help other animals
to survive here, too.

Crabs feed on dead skin
on the iguanas' back

and, in turn, provide
a welcome exfoliation service.

While smaller lizards prey on
the flies that pester the colony.

But not all the relationships
on this island are so harmonious.

Marine iguanas lay their eggs in sand.

In June, when the hatchlings emerge,
they're vulnerable.

They must join the adults
at the edge of the sea.

But the journey will be a dangerous one.

Racer snakes.

The snakes missed their chance.

But more babies are hatching.

And now the snakes are on the alert.

This is the best feeding opportunity
they will get all year.

On flat ground a baby iguana
can outrun a racer snake.

But others are waiting in ambush.

Another hatchling has its first glimpse
of a dangerous world.

A snake's eyes aren't very good,
but they can detect movement.

So if the hatchling keeps its nerve,
it may just avoid detection.

A near miraculous escape.

The lucky survivors

can begin learning
the unique way of life

demanded by this hostile island.

Although marine iguanas
are expert swimmers,

they can't cross open oceans.

But even the stormiest waters

are no barrier for birds.

Gale force winds and cold temperatures

make the subantarctic islands
off New Zealand

particularly unwelcoming in winter.

But when the brief summer comes,
temperatures rise and winds slacken.

It's now that visitors arrive.

All here to breed before winter returns.

There's the Snares penguins.

Shearwaters come, too.

This is an excellent place for them
to dig their nesting burrows,

for no predators
have managed to get here.

Soon the island is crowded with birds.

Every one of them eager to make
the most of the short breeding season.

But not everyone has a partner.

A male Buller's albatross
waits for his mate.

Each year they spend six months apart,
travelling the ocean.

They reunite here to breed.

But this year, she's late.

No, that's not her.

The other birds come and go.

The clock is ticking.

If she doesn't appear soon, it will be
too late for them to breed successfully.

Every morning the shearwaters fly off
to collect food for their young.

Everybody else seems
to be getting on with it.

The shearwaters' return
marks another lost day.

There are three million birds
on the island,

but only one matters to him.

Could this be her?

At last.

At first, he's a little coy.

But not for long.

They greet each other
with the special dance

they've perfected over many years.

There is much to do, if they're to raise
a chick before winter returns.

But when you've been apart
for six months,

some things can't be rushed.

Islands in warm tropical waters
don't experience seasonal extremes.

The Seychelles, lying off
the coast of East Africa,

provide a sanctuary
for seabirds all the year round.

Fairy terns are permanent residents.

They take a fairly relaxed view
about what constitutes a nest.

A bare branch is quite enough.

Climbing onto it to incubate
has to be done with care.

Once a year, the noddies arrive.

They do make nests, and Pisonia trees

provide their young with a rather
less precarious start in life.

Nesting on this island looks idyllic,

but behind the beauty
there's a sinister side.

The Seychelles fody makes quick work
of an unattended egg.

She knows something's not quite right,

but her drive to incubate is strong.

The noddies, too, have a problem.

As their chicks grow,

so the Pisonia tree
develops seeds that are sticky

and equipped with hooks.

By the time the young noddies leave

they carry these hitchhiking seeds
away to other islands.

But sometimes the Pisonia trees
are too successful.

If a fledgling testing out its wings
drops to the ground,

it can get covered with the seeds.

Entangled and weighed down,

if it can't free itself,
the youngster will starve.

The Pisonia may have failed
to disperse these seeds,

but it will soon have fertiliser
for its roots.

This is why some people call
the Pisonia the "bird catcher tree".

The Fairy tern laid another egg,

and now she has a tiny chick to feed.

This chick is lucky.

By the time it fledges,
the Pisonia seeds will have dispersed

and the danger
they brought will be gone.

Even the most idyllic looking of islands

presents challenges
for the animals living there.

But the greatest threat they face
is change.

Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.

For millions of years this remote
speck of land has been ruled by crabs.

Their ancestors came from the sea,

but most have now adopted
a land-based existence.

Given there are so many of them,
they get along relatively harmoniously.

They're the gardeners and caretakers
of a tiny crab utopia.

Once a year, they must all return
to the sea to breed,

and the march of the red crabs

is one of the greatest
natural spectacles on Earth.

There are 50 million of them.

It's an event that has brought
the island worldwide fame.

But in recent years,

millions of red crabs
haven't managed to reach the sea.

An invader has occupied this island.

Yellow crazy ants.

They escape from visiting ships,
and with no predators

to control them,
they have now created vast

super colonies in the forest.

When migrating
red crabs march into their territory,

the ants attack,

squirting acid
into the crabs' eyes and mouths.

The crabs have no defence.

Blinded and confused, they're doomed.

Humans brought these ant invaders here

and now humans are having
to control them.

Isolated communities may evolve
for millions of years in relative peace,

but when new challenges arrive,
they can struggle to cope.

Of all the species that have become
extinct in recent years,

around 80% have been islanders.

Our impact on the Earth is greater today
than ever before.

Yet some islands are so remote,

that few humans have even set foot
on them.

Zavodovski Island is one.

It lies in the great Southern Ocean.

It's not only surrounded
by the stormiest of seas,

it is itself an active volcano.

It's the last place on Earth
you'd choose to live.

Unless you're a chinstrap penguin.

There's plenty of food in these waters,
but to exploit it,

the penguins have to risk their lives.

Life here is dangerous in the extreme.

But there are some benefits from living
on a volcano.

Its warmth melts the snow
early in the year

and by January,
the Antarctic's mid-summer,

the island is covered in chicks.

Parents take turns at guarding them

until they're large enough
to be left alone.

This mother's chicks are hungry,
but she has no food left to give them.

Their survival depends on their father
returning with their next meal.

But some don't make it.

Skuas harass the colony
hoping to snatch a chick.

She can't risk leaving them.

Everything will be fine
as long as their father comes back soon.

He's been fishing
80 kilometres offshore,

but now, he's not far away.

For him, however,
and for all the other parents here,

the worst of the journey
is still to come.

Tiny claws help him to get
whatever grip he can on the rough lava.

For these commuters, it's rush hour.

Some have had a really bad day.

The father now has
a three-kilometre walk to the nest,

and a stomach loaded with food
doesn't help.

This is the largest penguin colony
in the world.

But as he makes the same journey
every other day,

he should be able to do it
with his eyes closed.

It's true that there can be safety
in numbers,

but numbers can also be something
of a problem

when you're trying to find
your own nest.

The mother is still waiting.

Her chicks are now desperate.

In the midst of all this
deafening chorus,

he can recognise her particular cry.

At last.

Both chicks will get a meal.

With a head bob of acknowledgement,
their mother now leaves.

It's her turn to do the feeding run.

This formidable commute is the price
these penguins pay for sanctuary.

A strange vision of paradise to us,
perhaps,

but for one and a half million penguins,

this island has it all.

Islands may seem remote
and insignificant,

but they are home to some of the most
precious wildlife on Earth.

Next time,

we ascend
into the planet's high mountains

to discover a spectacular
but hostile world

where life must be
at its most resourceful,

and only the toughest animals
can endure.
There are only
fourteen peaks in the world

that rise to over 8,000 metres.

All of them are here in the Himalayas.

Lethally cold,
scarred by gales and blizzards,

these mountains are among
the most hostile places on Earth.

Yet, a few special animals
manage to live here.

Snow leopards.

Like all creatures
of the high mountains,

they have had to adapt
both their body and their behaviour,

in order to survive.

Life at extreme altitude has shaped

some of the toughest animals
on the planet.

The sun-baked mountains
of the Arabian Peninsula.

They may only be a fraction
of the height of the Himalayas,

but they are still so dizzyingly steep

that in many places it's almost
impossible to get a foothold.

Yet, Nubian ibex
have made this their home.

The ibex choose the steepest cliffs
to raise their young

in safety,
beyond the reach of predators.

But living this sanctuary
comes with a cost.

These nursery slopes are so steep,

there is almost
no standing water up here.

So, to drink, an ibex family
must descend into the valley,

three hundred metres below.

The mothers pick out
the safest way down.

With soft cloven hooves that grip better
than any climbing shoe,

they are the most
accomplished mountaineers.

But the newborn kids
are still having to find their feet.

This is their first descent.

One mistake could make it their last.

Following the adults,
the kids finally reach the valley.

But once on level ground,
they're vulnerable.

Red foxes lie in wait.

At the first sign of danger,

the young ibex instinctively
run back to steeper ground.

But heading for
this particular rocky outcrop

could be a mistake.

It's a ten-metre drop.

The fox has them trapped,
or so it seems.

This is what ibex were born to do.

Scattering makes it hard
for the fox to pick a target.

And it certainly
can't follow them up here.

All it can do is wait
for one to slip and fall.

But these youngsters are fast learners

and they're now almost as sure-footed
as their parents.

The fox will have to find
its meal elsewhere.

It's just not been a good day.

Now, at last, the young ibex can drink.

But they'll soon need to return
to the safety of the sheer cliffs.

Mastering precipitous terrain
is always challenging,

but there are more fundamental problems
for life in the mountains.

The Alps, Europe's highest peaks.

It's winter,
and food is desperately short.

The golden eagle
has to spend every daylight hour

scanning the slopes for something,
somewhere, to eat.

Her two-metre wingspan
allows her to glide effortlessly

for over 100 kilometres in a single day.

Her extraordinary eyes
enable her to spot prey

from over three kilometres away.

But she is not the only one
who's looking for food.

When she spots a chance,
she must move fast.

She can dive at
over 300 kilometres an hour,

only a peregrine is faster.

During winter, even eagles rely
almost entirely on carrion.

It's a dead fox,
and it could sustain her for days.

Other scavengers must defer.

The hungry crows
soon regain their courage.

They'll try any trick to steal a morsel.

And they are annoyingly persistent.

But this mob
are the least of her worries.

A bigger eagle takes control.

But this kill
is too important to give up,

so she must fight.

For the moment,
she's won the carcass back.

But a kill like this will attract
every eagle for miles around.

As ever, the strongest
wins the lion's share.

Unable to defend the carcass any longer,

the first eagle
must now continue its search.

It may be many days
before she feeds again.

Only the most competitive

will survive the perils
of the mountain winter.

An avalanche,
nine million tonnes of snow

travelling at 120 kilometres an hour,

capable of smashing
everything in its path.

The mountains of North America

are hit by thousands of
avalanches every year.

Yet, one animal spends the whole winter

slumbering within the snow
on these avalanche-prone slopes.

And when spring comes, they emerge.

All across these mountains,

grizzly bears make their winter dens
up to 3,000 metres high

in the deep snow of leeward slopes.

And while they were
half asleep in the depths of winter,

their young were born.

Now, these cubs are taking their
first steps into the outside world.

This mother is leading
her three youngsters

to a place where they can find food.

They need to descend
as quickly as possible.

The debris from an avalanche
is clear evidence

that this slope is still
dangerously unstable.

This is not a place to dawdle.

And they have another reason
to keep moving.

After five months in the den,
these bears are very hungry.

Bears that have hibernated
throughout these peaks

now all descend to the valleys,

where spring comes earliest.

In the Rockies, seasonal change
is swift and dramatic.

In just a few days, the slopes
turn from white to green.

Meadows that only a few weeks ago
were buried beneath the snow

are now full of life.

But in these mountains,
the good times will not last long.

So the bears must feed
as fast as they can.

During the summer months,

an adult can put on 180 kilos,
gorging on plants.

And if they can catch them...

...a marmot or two.

But, just now, the bears have
something else on their minds.

It's becoming warmer,

and the bears are keen
to shed their thick winter coats.

Mothers show the cubs
what to do about this.

They'll soon catch on.

Some trees, it seems,
are particularly suitable for rubbing.

Bears have their favourites,

and will travel
long distances to visit them.

Some itches just have to be scratched.

There are now around
30 bears in this one valley.

As they rub, each leaves an individual
and recognisable scent.

So the tree soon
carries a list of who's around.

Which might help individuals
to avoid a fight.

To best spread their scent.

they really have to put
their back into it.

But the summer is short.

Itches satisfactorily scratched,

it's time to eat.

In a couple of months,

they will have to return
to their dens to hibernate.

So now they must put on
as much weight as they can.

Winter in the mountains returns fast
and hits hard.

Temperature in the Rockies
will drop to -65 degrees.

So cold, that moisture in the air
freezes into tiny crystals

called diamond dust.

This bobcat

is one of the few hunters
to remain active in winter.

Most of his prey
is now hidden beneath the snow

that covers his entire territory.

He hunts by listening for the faintest
sound of movement.

And to prevent crunching footsteps
from revealing his presence,

he uses boulders as stepping stones.

A mouse.

But one is not enough.

The deeper the snow,
the harder it is to detect prey,

and the rewards for the effort
can be disappointing.

To say the least.

By mid-winter, the snow is so deep,

the bobcats are forced
to leave their territories

to try and find easier hunting.

And this bobcat may be in luck,

for this particular valley is blessed.

A river here never freezes.

It's fed by a volcanic hot spring
that heats these waters

to 50 degrees warmer
than the surrounding air.

Hungry animals of all kinds
come here to feed.

Throughout the winter,
the river is full of food

for those who know how to catch it.

Here, even the coyotes
have become fishermen.

But hunting is hard for a cat
that's not used in getting its feet wet.

So he must choose his target with care.

Goldeneye ducks.

But can he get close enough to pounce?

Perhaps he'll have
more luck on the other side.

Here, steam from the river
warms the surrounding trees.

So, up in the branches,
there could be prey.

If only he could get to it.

It's six metres up.

At last, a squirrel.

Not much, but enough to keep him going.

To survive a winter in these mountains
takes tenacity,

and bobcats have that in abundance.

Snow on the equator.

Unlike the Rockies,

in these mountains
there are no marked seasons.

This is Africa's Mount Kenya.

It's over 5, 000 metres high,
which makes its summit

some 50 degrees colder
than the surrounding savannah.

Giant heathers, lobelias and groundsel
grow on its upper slopes.

They all thrive in the tropical sun.

After all, every day is summer.

But once the sun sets, every night
becomes as bitterly cold as winter.

The temperature drops
to five degrees below freezing...

...turning the mountainside
into a garden of ice.

Everything freezes.

But the cabbage groundsels
have a way of protecting themselves.

They close up their leathery leaves
to form an insulating blanket

that shields their vulnerable
central bud.

Night comes to an end...

...and the sunshine returns.

The groundsels spread their leaves wide
to bask in the sunshine once again.

Dawn, in the high Andes...

Here too, the rising sun
brings rapid relief

to animals living amongst
these volcanic peaks.

Mountain viscacha
are up early to claim the best places

to catch the sun's first rays.

For others up here,
the sunrise is even more welcome.

At over 4,000 metres,

this is the highest
flamingo colony in the world.

At night, it gets so cold
that even this salty water freezes over.

And now the flamingos
are trapped in the ice.

Eventually, the sun thins the ice.

But it's still a struggle
for the flamingos to break free.

Walking on thin ice is always risky.

And it's hard to retain one's dignity,

especially when you're wearing stilts.

At these altitudes,

the sun's power can quickly
turn from salvation to threat.

The atmosphere is so thin,

there is very little protection
from ultraviolet radiation.

By mid-morning,
it's risky to linger out in the open.

The viscacha are forced
to head for the shade.

Out on the lake,
there is nowhere to hide.

The white crust of the Soda Lake
reflects the sun's glare

and increases the impact
of its ultraviolet rays.

By mid-day, uncovered
human skin will burn in four minutes.

But this doesn't seem
to bother the flamingos.

In fact, they are on parade.

During the breeding season,

the flamingos perform
these peculiar courtship dances

even through the hottest
time of the day.

They're so eager,
they don't even pause to feed.

The rules are something of a mystery,
but after a month of dancing

all the birds will have paired off
and will be getting ready to mate.

Up here, there are few other
creatures to bother the flamingos.

But then, few other creatures
could even tolerate these conditions.

So, for animals
that have the endurance,

mountains can be sanctuaries.

But rocky peaks, which to us, perhaps,
seem a symbol of permanence,

are more fragile than they appear.

Today, in the Alps,

human encroachment
is changing even the highest summits.

In the Rockies, rising temperatures
are shortening winter hibernation

and stifling the growth
of valuable food plants.

And in the Andes,
some glaciers have shrunk

by 50% in just 30 years.

Even the Himalayas are now vulnerable.

With most of the world's tallest peaks

and covering a million
square kilometres,

this is the greatest
mountain range of all.

And here, temperatures are now
rising faster than the global average.

As the snow line retreats
further and further up these peaks,

there is less
and less space for wildlife.

And that is a challenge

for one of the most majestic
of all mountain creatures.

The snow leopard.

Seldom seen.

The detail of their lives
has long been a mystery.

But now at last, helped by
the latest remote camera technology,

we're getting closer to them
than ever before.

They're very rare.

Only about four of them
in a hundred square kilometres.

There is simply not enough prey
to sustain more.

They live solitary lives.

Nonetheless, they are well aware

of the presence
and the movements of their neighbours

because they leave messages
in a few special places.

They rub particular rocks
with their cheeks.

And they spray them with urine.

The two perfumes
create a unique signature.

Any other leopard can know
which of its neighbours passed this way,

without ever making direct contact.

But there are times
when snow leopards must come together

and the event is often violent.

An adult female and her daughter.

She has devoted the last two years
to raising her cub,

and very soon, it will be weaned.

For now, the cub is still
entirely dependent on its mother.

But staying together as long as this
could cause problems.

The female is now in heat again,

and any male that
smells her signature will know that.

From this moment on,
her cub's life is at risk.

Males kill cubs that are not their own.

But the mother is now driven
by an urge that she cannot control.

She lets the males know exactly
where she is.

From up here,
she can be heard from miles around.

A young male emerges from
the wilderness, eager to find her.

Snow leopards meet so infrequently
that there is uncertainty and tension.

And it's about to get worse.

Another bigger male has arrived.

The mother and cub
are trapped between the rivals.

The cub is now in danger.
Mother must act fast.

To divert the males' attention
from her cub,

she rolls over submissively.

With the males fixed on the female,
the cub has a chance to escape.

The males close in
on the mother from both sides,

keen to claim her for their own.

A fight is inevitable.

The female moves
to escape and protect her cub.

But the big male follows her.

He will not let her leave
until he has mated with her.

With the males gone, the female
is at last reunited with her cub.

But she has been injured.

The cub, however, is alive,
thanks to its mother.

Until her injury heals,
she won't be able to hunt.

Mountain animals survive on
the very edge of existence.

Mother and cub were not seen again.

Until, over a month later,

high on a ridge,
a remote camera was triggered.

The female cat.

She's no longer limping
but she's now alone.

Then an hour after the female has left,
the camera is triggered again.

It's her cub, taking her first steps
towards adulthood and independence.

She is unlikely to see her mother again.

But every now and then,
they will be reunited

through the messages they leave
on the marking rocks.

Her mother has succeeded
in raising her,

but life ahead will be challenging,

and she will spend
nearly all of it alone.

Only the toughest can survive

among the savage beauty
of the world's highest mountains.

Next time,
we explore the world's jungles.

Places of surprise and invention
unrivalled on Earth...

where the battle for survival
is at its most intense.Earth is the only planet

we know of where life exists.

- And here, it does so in abundance.
{BIRDS CHIRPING)

The jungle is Eden.

It covers less than 6%
of the Earth's surface,

but it's home to half of all
the plants and animals on land.

jungles have just the right amount
of light, water and nutrients,

and they have had
every day for millennia.

Life here should be easy.

This is an indri.

It's a primate like us,

and these forests in Madagascar
are its home.

But to survive here

it has to face one major challenge.

Paradise is crowded.

Life fills every niche.

And at any one time,

a staggering variety of species
and countless individuals

are striving for space and food.

Like every jungle animal,

indri have to find their own way
to survive

in the most competitive place on Earth.

jungles are complex places.

Tangled, three-dimensional worlds
created by lush tropical vegetation.

90% of the animals here
spend their whole lives up in the trees,

and each of them has to find
its own way of getting around.

Hanging 30 metres above the ground,

a spider monkey.

They travel in family groups
and find everything they need

in the top storey of the jungle.

Up here isn't a place
for the faint-hearted.

With long limbs and a prehensile tail
that can grip like a hand,

they're built for climbing.

But imagine having to learn these skills
as high up as this.

One-third of spider monkeys
never make it to adulthood.

This youngster is only a few months old.

Her future depends on
her ability to climb.

Playing on a practice tree
with her older brother and sister,

she's already learning to use her tail
as a safety line...

...under her father's close watch.

She's keen to join in the game,

but she's the youngest
and, as is the way of things,

she's not always welcome.

So she chooses her own place to play.

But not all trees are the same.

This one is for more advanced climbers.

Enthusiasm?

Certainly.

Technique?

Room for improvement.

Meanwhile, some of her family
have moved on

to look for a new patch of fresh food.

The top of the canopy
isn't for youngsters.

But father's not looking

And the temptation to join
the others is irresistible.

She'll need to be careful.

A fall from here
will mean certain death.

It's the first time she's been
as high as this on her own.

As she climbs still higher,
the branches get thinner and thinner.

Her tail has caught her.

But now she's stuck in mid-air,
unable to reach any other branch.

Father, however, was watching.

He's big and strong enough
to form a bridge with his body

so that she can climb to safety.

Lesson learned.

But it's not just monkeys
that live here up in the treetops.

And if you are small,

finding the right tree
can mean a home for life.

He's a Draco lizard.

He's only the size of a pencil
and he eats ants.

This one tree could provide him
with all he will ever need.

A conveyor belt of food.

It's a perfect place to settle down.

Well, it would be...

...but there's already someone here.

This larger male is the tree's owner

and Dracos don't share.

The owner's flag is a warning.

Trespassers won't be tolerated.

The owner's not only intimidating,

he's prepared to battle.

A dead end.

Safety is a long way away.

Now he must choose.

Fight?

Or flee?

Only in the jungle do you find lizards
that can soar like dragons.

He can travel over 30 metres
in a single leap.

It's a very fast and efficient way
to move through the jungle.

Maybe this new tree will have food

and no resident owner.

Everything in the jungle
has to compete for space.

Only 2% of the sun's rays
reach the ground,

so even the plants must battle

for the light they need
if they're to grow.

500 years ago, this hura tree
began its race for light,

and, every day since, it has absorbed
the water and sunshine it needed

to grow into a giant.

It has succeeded in doing
what every tree must do to survive.

Rise above the gloom
of the jungle floor.

And, what is more, its success
has given life to others.

Its branches now carry
a thousand other plants.

These particular ferns, figs and orchids

live only on the branches
of other trees.

A thousand plants
growing on one single tree.

Throughout the forest,
this story is repeated endless times.

As a consequence, jungles are home
to more species of plants

than anywhere else on Earth.

And they, in turn,
support a wealth of animals.

In Ecuador the competition
is at its most intense.

Here they are a hundred species
of hummingbirds alone.

All fighting for nectar.

Each flower only has a small amount
at any one time

and so it's first come, first served.

One hummingbird
has gone to great lengths

to avoid conflict with other species.

Sword-bills are the only bird
with a beak longer than their body.

And some flowers are too elongated

for the other 99 species
of hummingbirds here to feed from them.

A sword-bill's
extraordinary beak, however,

enables it to reach the places
that others can't.

The top of this flower,
where the sweet nectar is produced.

It has found a solution that means
it doesn't have to join the fight.

And as each long flower blooms,

it gives the sword-bill a fresh supply
of food all to itself.

But having a beak longer than your body
does have its drawbacks.

For a start,
it's tricky to keep it clean.

Harder still, how do
you preen your body feathers?

Unlike the other hummers,

wword-bills can't reach their feathers
with their beak.

The only option,

a good old scratch.

It's a little unrefined,

but a small price to pay
for an exclusive food supply.

Especially when feeding times are only
too frequently interrupted by storms.

jungles are the richest places on Earth
because of one remarkable fact.

They make their own weather.

Every day water rises from the surface
of the leaves as vapour.

It's as if the trees breathe out clouds.

They gather over the forest,
until, finally...

...they burst.

Rain is the lifeblood of every jungle.

And all have to do their best
to endure the daily downpour.

In some jungles, like here in Brazil,

it rains so much that
for part of the year,

the trees are almost totally submerged.

The forest floor is ten metres
below the water's surface.

This is a mysterious world.

A place few people have ever explored.

We have much to discover about
the animals for which this is home.

Including some you might never
expect to find amongst trees.

One and a half thousand kilometres
from the sea,

are dolphins.

A newly identified species
of river dolphin

found nowhere else on Earth.

In these black, tangled waters,
they have become almost totally blind,

so they move slowly,

carefully using their sonar
to scan the forest floor for fish.

If this forest can hide
a new species of dolphin,

what else might there be here,
awaiting discovery?

At the shallow margins
of the flooded jungle,

rivers flow through lush vegetation.

Here, food is so abundant,
it supports giants.

Capybara, the biggest rodents
in the world.

Giant otters, the size of a man.

And the rulers of these rivers.

Caiman.

They grow to ten feet long,

and kill anything
they get between their jaws.

But there are more artful hunters

drawn here from the surrounding forest.

A jaguar, the supreme jungle predator.

The river marks
the edge of his territory.

But here, he has competition.

He's now in the territory of a female.

She has ruled this stretch of river
for five years.

This is her place to hunt.

Capybara are strong and wary.

The key is stealth.

She needs to get within a metre
if she's to pounce.

Not this time.

She's not the only female here.

Each part of this jungle's edge
is ruled by a different queen.

Few places on Earth have enough food
to support so many big cats.

The male hunts in a different way.

Weighing almost 150 kilos,
it's hard to be stealthy.

And with so many other jaguars around,

he doesn't bother with wary capybara.

He seeks a different prey.

He's become a killer of killers.

jaguars have the most powerful bite...

- ...of any cat.

And he knows
the caiman's most vulnerable point,

the back of its skull.

Hunters living in the dense
understorey of the jungle

come in all shapes and sizes,

but they share a problem.

How to tell what is a plant
and what is prey.

This is a game of hide and seek,

that can be won or lost
in the blink of an eye.

The long contest
between predator and prey

has produced mimicry
of astounding accuracy.

A leaf-tailed gecko
masquerading as lichen.

Some animals take camouflage
a stage further still.

And these streams in Costa Rica
are home to one of the most remarkable.

A glass frog.

A male, and tiny,
no bigger than your fingernail,

and almost entirely transparent.

As he needs to be.

Almost everything that walks past here
could eat him.

Even a cricket.

His best chance
is to stay absolutely still,

and trust that the cricket
looks right through him.

Danger passed,

and that's just as well,

because he is a father.

And he's guarding
some very precious eggs.

For the last few weeks,
females, one after the other,

have visited him
and entrusted him with their offspring.

Some are now almost ready to hatch.

There are several clutches on the leaf,

and those at the top,
the most recently laid,

are barely a day old.

But in the jungle,
there's always someone out to get you.

This wasp is a specialist hunter
of frog's eggs.

It's noticed the wriggling tadpoles
at the bottom of the leaf.

He mustn't move.

The youngest eggs
are the most vulnerable,

and he can't guard them all.

But these tadpoles are not as helpless
as they might appear.

Incredibly, the un-hatched tadpoles
can sense danger,

and the oldest and strongest
wriggle free,

and drop into the stream below.

The eggs at the top
of the leaf, however,

are still too young to hatch,

and now the wasps know they're there.

But the male's back looks very like
the youngest cluster of eggs.

And that seems to confuse the wasps.

Using his on body as decoy
is a huge risk.

The wasps' stings could kill him.

He's managed to save most of his young.

He'll have to remain on guard
for another two weeks.

But in the jungle,
just surviving the day

can count as a SUCCESS.

With the coming of the night,

a new cast of jungle characters
takes to the stage.

Flying insects begin to glow
as they search for mates.

Fungi, unlike plants,

thrive in the darkness
of the forest floor.

They're hidden, until they begin
to develop the incredible structures

with which they reproduce.

Each releases
millions of microscopic spores

that drift invisibly away.

Many have fruiting bodies
that reach upwards

to catch any feeble current
there might be

in the clammy air.

But this one, as it grows,
becomes luminous.

Why fungi light up
has remained a mystery...

...until now.

Scientists studying
the brightest fungi in the world

think they may have an answer.

Like a beacon,
the light attracts insects...

...from far and wide.

To this click beetle,

a bright light means only one thing,

a female click beetle.

So, he flashes in reply.

But he doesn't get
the reception he was expecting.

Confused, he starts
searching for a female

and that helps the fungus.

By the time he gives up,

he's covered in the fungus' spores.

And as he continues
his quest for a female,

he carries these spores
to other parts of the forest.

And there are even stranger things
glowing in the jungle night.

These are the multi-coloured lights
of a railroad worm.

It's not really a worm,

but a poisonous,
caterpillar-like beetle.

The yellow lights warn other creatures
to keep out of its way.

It's hunting for millipedes.

When it finds the trail of one,

it switches off its yellow lights.

Now, it only has
a red light on its head.

Millipedes can't see red light.

So, to them,
the railroad worm in stealth mode

is virtually invisible.

And that is the end of the millipede.

Competition in the jungles

forces animals to specialise
in every aspect of their life,

including courtship.

This has produced
some of the most beautiful

and elaborate displays on the planet.

A male red bird-of-paradise

competing to attract
a female by dancing.

One has come to survey what's on offer.

She is an independent lady

and she will select
whichever male takes her fancy.

She makes her choice.

But now she doesn't seem quite so sure.

No.

Perhaps he's just a little too keen.

Maybe he'll have better luck tomorrow.

Red birds-of-paradise
display in the tree tops.

Other members of the family
dance in the gloom of the forest floor.

This is a Wilson's bird-of-paradise.

He's brightly coloured,

but about the size of a sparrow.

He's lived most of his life alone.

But now he's an adult,

and he too needs to attract a mate.

This little patch of light
might help him do so.

First, he tidies things up.

Showing off in this jumble of leaves
wouldn't be easy,

and his beauty will stand out better
against a plain background.

He doesn't want bright leaves
to divert a visitor's attention.

They all need to go.

Even the green ones.

Especially the green ones.

His stage is set.

A central pole
and a little patch of light...

It's perfect.

And now he must hope
a female hears his call.

He can wait here for weeks on end.

At last, a female.

Time to take up position.

She will judge him
by the brightness of his feathers.

But for the female
to see him at his best,

he needs her to perch
directly above his stage,

under the light.

This might be his only chance to shine.

Now, when she's looking
directly down on him,

he reveals a display for her eyes only.

In the gloom of the forest floor,

he is a dazzling blaze
of iridescent green.

The brightest "leaf" in the forest.

And that does the trick.

Each animal must find its own way

of surviving the competition
of the jungle.

This crowded world
is so full of invention

that almost all kinds of animals on land
can trace their origins back here...

Including us.

These forests in Madagascar
are home to one of our distant cousins.

This female indri has fought
to keep this particular patch of forest

safe for herself and her family.

Every morning, the family
come together to sing,

their way of reminding others
that this is their home.

Indri are so closely adapted
to living here,

that now they can live nowhere else.

For them, and the billions of animals
with whom they share their home,

the jungle is a sanctuary.

But this is changing.

Even in the ten years
since the head of this family was born,

ten thousand square kilometres of
the rainforest have been destroyed

in Madagascar alone,

and, with it, half the indri families
that once lived there.

The local people say
the indris are our brothers

and their song is a call to remind us

that we too once depended on the jungle.

This Eden is still a place
of wonder and magic.

Something surely worth protecting.

Next time...

A land of extremes,
that pushes life to the limit.

Animals have extraordinary ways
of dealing with the hostile conditions.

Creating the most epic
survival stories on Earth...

These are deserts.
Imagine a world

where temperatures rise
to 50 degrees Centigrade,

where there's no escape
from sun, wind and dust.

Imagine a world
with almost no food or water.

These are the conditions
in one-third of the lands of our planet.

To live here

demands the most extraordinary
survival strategies.

This is the oldest desert in the world.

The Namib in southwest Africa.

It's been dry for 55 million years.

Life here for a hunter
is as hard as it gets.

A pride of lions,

one of the very few

that endures
this desert's scorching temperatures

and lack of water.

Hunting here presents special problems.

A herd of oryx,

the only prey within 30 kilometres.

Out here,
there is no cover for an ambush.

It will have to be a straight chase.

They have failed,

and each failed hunt
brings the lions closer to starvation.

To find enough to eat,

the pride continually searches
an area the size of Switzerland.

Three days and 150 kilometres later,

and still, no kill.

These are desperate times.

A dry riverbed
on the edge of their territory.

The only animals here are giraffe.

But these one-tonne giants
could kill a lion

with a single kick.

Lions seldom tackle
such formidable prey.

But this pride can't go on much longer

- without food.

The whole pride
must work together as a team,

if they're to succeed.

Two lionesses lead the chase.

Others race to cut off
possible escape routes.

The giraffe has the speed and stamina
to outrun the pride.

But it's being chased into a trap.

Up ahead, the lead female waits.

It's now up to her.

(MGM

Most lion hunts end in failure.

But no lions fail more often
than those that live in the desert.

Once again,

the pride must continue their search.

It does sometimes rain in the desert.

Here in the American West,

storms can strike
with devastating force.

After 10 months of drought,
millions of tonnes of water

are dumped on the land in under an hour.

Over millions of years,

sand and gravel
carried by the rampaging floods

have carved channels
through the solid rock.

Salt canyons, 50 metres deep.

In some places,
these canyons have widened

until the land between them is sculpted
into table lands and isolated pinnacles,

some of the most
dramatic landscapes on the planet.

The rain may be long gone,

but there is water here,

locked away within the tissues
of specialist desert plants.

Cacti are unique to American deserts.

They all hoard water,
storing it in swollen stems,

and protecting it
behind a barricade of spines.

They're so successful
that they dominate these deserts.

But this forest of spikes

can cause problems
for the animals that live here.

A Harris hawk.

It has developed special techniques
for hunting amongst the cacti.

Ground squirrels.

Prey.

At the first sign of danger,
they bolt for the safety of the thorns.

But the hawks have a tactic
to flush them out.

These are the only birds of prey
that hunt in packs.

Flying in formation,

they try to drive their quarry
into the open.

But this squirrel is staying put.

So now the hawks continue the hunt

on foot.

They're closing in from all sides.

Soon, all escape routes are cut off.

The squirrel is trapped.

The spines that cover
almost every plant in this desert

can provide protection and shelter
for many animals.

So, why should these spikes
be hung with corpses?

What kind of creature
could be responsible

for creating such a gruesome scene?

There's a mysterious killer
at work in this desert.

It's a butcher bird.

This little song bird uses the spines
as a butcher uses his hook,

to hold its prey as it dismembers it.

And with chicks to feed,
he also uses the spines as a larder.

He's been stocking it for weeks.

Hanging his prey out of the reach
of scavengers on the ground

ensures that his newly-hatched young
will never go hungry.

An ingenious solution

to making the good times
last in the desert,

if a little macabre.

Some deserts are so arid,

they appear totally devoid
of all vegetation.

Yet even these landscapes

can be transformed

in a matter of days.

The deserts of Peru
are amongst the driest in the world.

But just add a little water,

and plants
that have lain dormant for months

will burst into life.

And when a desert suddenly turns green,

even the most seemingly desolate

can become a land of opportunity.

No creature exploits
the greening of a desert more quickly,

or more dramatically,

than a locust.

Madagascar's arid southwest

has received
its highest rainfall in years.

Now, an army is on the march,

attracted by the smell
of newly-sprouting grass.

Locusts are normally solitary creatures,

but when food becomes
suddenly plentiful,

they come together
into an unstoppable force

that devours everything in its path.

But this devastation
is about to get a lot worse.

The locusts now transform
into winged adults.

And with conditions as good as this,

they do so three times
faster than normal.

Now, they are at their most voracious.

And with wings,
they can take to the skies.

Once airborne, the locusts can travel
over 100 kilometres a day

in their search for new feeding grounds.

A super-swarm of this scale
may only appear once in a decade.

This one extends
over 500 square kilometres

and contains
several billion individuals.

Between them, they will devour
40,000 tonnes of food in a day.

Nothing can strip a land
of its vegetation with such speed

and thoroughness as a plague of locusts.

When the food eventually runs out,
the whole army will die.

But not before it's devastated the land.

With no plants to bind them,

thin soils soon turn to dust
and blow away.

Now, these barren lands
are left to the mercy of the elements.

Scorched by the sun
and scoured by windblown sand,

desert rock is shaped into strange,
otherworldly landscapes.

These rocky deserts
may have a beguiling beauty,

but when they become this barren,
very little life can endure.

For many animals,

the only way to survive
the most hostile times

is to keep moving.

In the Kalahari,

brief rains have given way
to the dry season.

Food and water
are becoming increasingly scarce.

For these zebra, it's time to leave.

They are setting off
on the longest over-land migration

made by any mammal in Africa,

marching towards the scent
of distant rains.

As drought intensifies,

desert-living elephants
must also undertake long journeys

in search of water.

The older females can remember where,
even in times of extreme drought,

there may still be water,

and sometimes lead the herd

to a waterhole they may not
have visited for decades.

These zebra are almost
at the end of their journey.

This is what they've been heading for.

A rare waterhole.

In deserts,
most waterholes are short-lived.

They appear after rains,

but then vanish
almost as quickly as they came.

Animals have come here
from many kilometres around.

Yet, this can be a dangerous place
in which to linger.

A hundred kilometres away,
in the heart of the desert,

sandgrouse chicks are hatching.

It's safer for them to be here.

But being so distant
from water is a gamble.

With only their mother
to shield them from the sun,

if they get nothing to drink,

they will be dead within hours.

Their only hope is their father.

Every morning,
he makes the 200-kilometre round trip

to get water for the family.

Grouse from all over the desert
visit this oasis,

arriving together in large flocks.

And that is important.

There's safety in numbers.

The male snatches a drink,

but he also needs to collect
water for his chicks.

Using specially-adapted breast feathers,

he can soak up water like a sponge.

But it takes time,

and he is in danger.

Goshawk.

Sandgrouse here are their main prey.

Again and again,

the male sandgrouse risk their lives

in order to collect water
for their chicks.

This is why sandgrouse
nest so far from waterholes.

At last,

he's soaked up as much as he can.

Carrying a quarter
of his bodyweight in water,

he can now set off
on the long journey home.

He's back, and just in time.

He can give the chicks
their first-ever drink.

But he will have to undertake
this perilous journey

every day for the next two months,

until his chicks

can finally make the flight
to the waterhole for themselves.

It's July in the deserts of Nevada

in the western United States.

The hottest time of the year.

Bands of wild horses, mustang,

are converging on one of the last
remaining waterholes around.

Now, water not only offers them
the chance to drink.

It can also bring power.

If a stallion can control
access to water,

he will have secured mating rights
to the entire herd.

So stallions
try to dominate these pools,

fighting off rivals
who venture too close.

A stranger.

He's travelled 15 kilometres to be here

because the pools where he's come from
have already dried up.

With him come his females.

If he can't provide them with water,

they will leave him
for the white stallion

who already dominates this pool.

So he will have to fight.

There is everything to lose.

A broken leg or a shattered jaw
would mean a slow and painful death.

A missed kick,

and it's all over.

The new arrival has won.

And his prize
is more than just a chance to drink.

He has provided for his herd,
and in the process,

stolen his rival's females.

The white stallion's rule is over.

Desert life is not only shaped
by the scarcity of water,

but also by the relentless power

of the sun.

The highest temperatures on Earth
have all been recorded in its deserts.

Changes in the climate

mean temperatures here
are rising more than the global average.

And as deserts heat up,

they are also expanding.

Every year,

a further 150,000 square kilometres
of grass and farmland

are turning into barren stretches
of dust and rock.

In the heat of the day,

surface temperatures
can reach a scorching 70 degrees,

far too hot to handle for most.

But not for this shovel-snouted lizard.

Raising its feet off the ground in turn

enables each to briefly cool.

But even this dancing desert specialist

can't stand the heat for long.

One option is to find shade.

Dune grass, the only vegetation here,
provides virtually none.

But just beneath
the surface of the sand,

it is several degrees cooler.

Avoiding the extreme heat
imposes a rhythm on desert life.

And many animals here
choose the simplest option of all,

staying hidden all day

and only venturing out
in the cool of the night.

As darkness falls,

animals appear from seemingly nowhere.

And among them, inevitably,

are hunters.

One of the most voracious
nocturnal predators

is also one of the hardest to see.

This mysterious creature

hardly ever appears
on the surface of the dunes.

But there are signs on the sand
that can give it away.

It lives only here,

where the sand grains
are so perfectly dry and polished

that they flow almost like water.

It's no bigger than a Ping-Pong ball.

A golden mole.

It's totally blind,

but there's nothing
to see underground anyway.

Instead, it has superb hearing.

Its entire head acts as an amplifier

that picks up vibrations
through the sand.

So, to locate prey
on the surface of the dune,

it has, paradoxically,
to thrust its face into the dune.

Termites.

Not easy to catch when you're blind.

Far better to go into stealth mode.

Once below the sand,

it can detect the slightest movement,

allowing it to strike
with pinpoint accuracy.

Well, most of the time.

It can travel two-thirds of a mile
a night in search of its dinner.

And right now,
it has just detected its main course.

Little wonder it's sometimes called
"the shark of the dunes".

Food can be so scarce in the desert

that even at night,
animals can't afford to be choosy

about what they eat.

Israel's Negev Desert.

Otonycteris, the desert long-eared bat,

is on the hunt.

Most bats
catch flying insects on the wing.

But there are so few of these
in the desert

that this bat
must do things differently.

It has to hunt on the ground.

But what really sets it apart

is what it's hunting.

A deathstalker scorpion.

The venom of this species
is potent enough to kill a human.

Tackling it seems madness
for a bat weighing just 15 grams.

In the pitch black,

both predator and prey
are effectively blind.

But the scorpion has one advantage,

he can sense the approach of the bat
through vibrations in the sand.

Otonycteris must rely
entirely on its hearing.

If the scorpion doesn't move,
it won't know it's there.

The battle is on.

Armed with crushing pincers
and a sting loaded with venom,

this scorpion is a dangerous opponent.

A direct strike on the head.

Is it all over?

Not for this bat.

Otonycteris clearly has some immunity
to the venom,

but repeated stings
must still be extraordinarily painful.

And if the bat is not to go hungry,

it must catch another three scorpions
before sunrise.

Desert animals
have developed remarkable strategies

to make the most
of the rare opportunities

that come their way.

Although some deserts
may not see rain for several years,

most will hold a little water
in one form or another.

The trick
is simply knowing how to reach it.

Dawn in the dunes of the Namib,

and something magical is happening.

Moist air
lying over the neighbouring Atlantic

is cooled and blown inland,

forming fog banks
that shroud the desert in mist.

This precious moisture

lies tantalisingly out of reach
at the top of the dunes,

and it won't last long.

It will be burnt off by the sun
just hours after it rises.

Darkling beetles
race to the top of the dunes

to reach the fog before it vanishes.

Some of the Namib's dunes
are 300 metres high,

the tallest in the world.

For a beetle no larger than a thumbnail,

this is the equivalent
of us climbing a dune

twice the height of Everest.

But even more impressive

is what it does next.

Standing perfectly still,
facing into the wind,

the beetle does a headstand.

Fog begins to condense on its body.

Microscopic bumps on its wing cases

direct the water to grooves
that channel it towards the mouth.

Before returning down the slip face,

it will drink 40% of its body weight.

This little beetle

has learned how to conjure water
out of the air

in one of the driest places on Earth.

And it's not alone
on the top of the dunes.

Web-footed geckos use a similar trick.

Surely, few animals
go to greater lengths to get a drink.

Unfortunately, Namaqua chameleons
know that on foggy mornings,

the beetles coming down the dunes
are juicier than those going up.

The diversity of life

that thrives in a world
almost totally devoid of water

is truly remarkable.

Success in the desert

depends on an extraordinary variety
of survival strategies

that have evolved
over millions of years.

But our planet is changing.

The world's deserts
are growing bigger, hotter and drier,

and they're doing so
faster than ever before.

How life will cope here in the future

remains to be seen.

Next time,
we journey to the world's Great Plains.

Where spectacular gatherings of wildlife

cope with extreme change.

And surprising creatures survive

in unexpected ways.
One quarter of all the land on Earth

is covered by a single,
remarkable type of plant.

Almost indestructible,
it can grow half a metre a day...

...and be tall enough to hide a giant.

That plant is grass,

and the world it creates
is truly unique.

The grass in northern India
is the tallest on the planet,

home to some of the most
impressive creatures to tread the Earth.

These are the good times,

but in just a few months,
all this fresh growth will be gone,

and the animals
will be forced to move on.

That is the way things are
on grasslands across the planet.

A cycle of abundance,
destruction and rebirth

that affects every creature
that lives here.

The largest grassland on Earth,
the vast Eurasian Steppe,

stretches one third of the way
around our planet.

Spring rain has brought fresh grass,
and with it, new life.

A relic from the Ice Age,
a baby Saiga antelope,

just three hours old.

His only company, his twin.

Until they can stand, their mother
has left them hidden in the grass.

They should be safe,
as long as they remain quiet.

For these calves,
the clock is already ticking.

Their herd will soon be moving on,
seeking the freshest new grass.

Their lanky legs are a sure sign that
they're built for a life on the move.

Saiga always give birth to twins,

so their numbers grow rapidly
just when grass is plentiful.

Their bizarrely shaped nose
can detect fresh growth

from hundreds of kilometres away.

The young twins will now
begin the nomadic life

they share with most animals
on the world's open plains.

Grasslands occur where rain is
too sporadic for forests to exist.

The rain that a grassland
needs to survive for a year

might arrive all at once.

Storms like these can release
30 centimetres of rain in 24 hours.

Not much fun if you're out in it.

Eventually the earth
can't soak up any more,

and the grassland undergoes
a radical change.

Many plants would drown here,
but grasses thrive.

They grow so fast,

their leaves quickly rise above
the water and into the sunlight.

Here in southern Africa,

water transforms one of the most
remarkable grasslands on Earth,

the Okavango.

Every year, 8,000 square kilometres
of grassland are flooded.

For one pride of lions,
this poses a major problem.

There may be plenty of prey around,

but lions struggle
to run it down in water.

The pride has three-month-old cubs.
They've never seen water before.

If their mothers
don't make a kill soon,

the cubs might not survive the week.

But fuelled by the flood, the eruption
of grass attracts new possible prey.

Buffalo arrive in herds 2,000 strong.

Powerful, aggressive and united,

they're the most dangerous animal
a lion can face.

The biggest bulls don't run.

They're simply too huge
to be scared of lions.

At 900 kilos, he weighs more
than all five lionesses combined.

The pride do have numbers on their side,

but one sweep of his horns
could be deadly.

One distracts the bull up front,
while her sisters attack from behind.

The cats must somehow
topple the buffalo,

but with swamp under foot,
they can't get any traction.

The bull is weakening,

but the lions are tiring, too.

It's now a battle of will
as much as strength.

To live, the bull must somehow
shake off the lioness.

The bull is wounded,

but thanks to his thick hide,
he will recover.

For the pride, these are hungry times.

But, ultimately, once the water recedes,
there will be new life,

and new food to benefit all.

In the right conditions,
grasses have the extraordinary ability

to grow from first shoots to flower
in a matter of only days.

Grasses become the miniature equivalents
of fruiting trees.

And for creatures living
within the grass,

this is a landscape as vast
and towering as any rainforest.

An excellent place
to build a tiny tree house

for a harvest mouse.

During summer,
European meadowlands are full of food,

but only for those that can reach it.

Climbing grass is harder
than climbing trees,

not least because their stems
just won't stay still.

Her prehensile tail
acts like a fifth limb,

so she's as agile as a monkey
clambering around in a tree.

And just as well,

for the best food in this tiny forest
is at the very top of its canopy.

Feeding up here, she's exposed.

A barn owl.

Not her finest move...

But it did the trick.

Harvest mice seldom go
all the way down to the ground.

It's a tangled and
dangerous world down here.

But she can read the pattern
of the stems overhead like a map,

and so find her way home.

And not a minute too soon.

There are mouths to feed.

Her babies must fatten up quickly.

They need to harvest the summer grasses
while they're still rich with food.

On the African savannah, too,
seasonal grasses are filled with life,

but it won't last long.

Carmine bee-eaters
are superb aerial hunters,

experts at catching insects in mid-air.

But they have no way of
flushing their prey out of the grass.

Once alarmed, most insects stay put.

The bee-eaters need someone
to stir things up a bit.

A kori bustard.

It's the world's heaviest flying bird,

so it should be bulky enough
to kick up some insects.

Bingo!

Until someone else comes along
and cramps your style.

Never mind, perhaps there are
bigger opportunities ahead.

What about an ostrich?

The heaviest bird of all.

This time there's more than enough
transport to go around.

Soon, almost every ostrich
has its own passenger.

But free riders are only
tolerated for so long.

What the bee-eaters really need

is a creature so big
it won't even notice them.

Nothing cuts a swathe through grass
like an African bull elephant.

The trick is to fly as close to
the front of the giant as possible.

They only have a split second
to grab the prize.

As more insects are stirred up,
the competition intensifies.

With summer drawing to a close,
the race to stock up is on.

Soon, the grass will wither,
and this opportunity will have gone.

As the dry season takes hold,

food becomes increasingly thin
on the ground.

Now, only the most specialised predators
on the plains can make a living.

She may be spotted like a cheetah,
but this cat is no sprinter.

Instead, she has extra-long legs
which give her a high vantage point.

But a serval cat's main weapon
are enormous radar ears.

They help her pinpoint prey
hiding in the grass.

But the prey she seeks are canny.

Southern vlei rats.

They know that any sustained movement
can give them away.

So they move in short bursts.

But even the slightest rustle
will give her a clue.

Warm.

Warmer.

Missed.

In better times,
she could catch 70 a day,

but now, with so few rodents around,
she will have to go hungry.

As drought intensifies,
life gets tougher for all.

Predators with permanent territories
must tough it out,

while most of their prey
disappear over the horizon.

To avoid starvation, many grassland
animals follow a nomadic way of life.

Over 2,000,000 wildebeests wander
the East African savannahs

chasing the rains.

And they are not alone.

Arriving on the wing,

Jackson's Widowbirds
also seek fresh grass.

Although, it's not just
food that they're after.

This male wants a mate.

He's grown elaborate breeding plumage
for this moment,

but he needs a stage
on which to show it off.

By carefully selecting grass blades,
each trimmed to the correct length,

he's creating something very special.

He needs an even surface,

and a centre-piece.

The stage is set.

His bachelor pad is sufficiently
neat and tidy to attract a female.

The problem is,

can she see it?

He has competition.

It might take more than a little
gardening to impress the ladies.

jumping is the right idea,

but he's misjudged
the height of the grass.

His rival makes it look easy.

Time to raise his game.

It's not only who jumps the highest,
but who can keep doing so the longest.

Unable to go the distance,
his rivals drop out one by one.

Stamina has won him admirers,

now he can show off
his courtship arena...

And engage in a little
romantic hide-and-seek.

Finally, he's done enough.

The East African savannahs
support millions of grazers.

Each year they devour
millions of tonnes of grass,

and yet there's one creature here

whose impact is far greater
than all these animals combined.

They're found wherever
grass grows on the planet,

yet their labours go
almost entirely unnoticed.

One of the most remarkable is found here
on the grasslands of South America.

These blades are so tough that virtually
no large grass eaters can stomach them.

Yet they're harvested
on an industrial scale...

...by tiny grass cutter ants.

But they themselves
can't digest one bit of it.

So, why bother?

The answer is underground,

and it's very ingenious.

Each blade is cut to length
and placed into a garden of fungus.

The rotting grass feeds the fungus,
and in turn the fungus feeds the ants.

But feeding 5,000,000 workers
requires intensive agriculture.

Luckily, they are an industrious lot.

This colony alone will collect
over half a tonne of grass every year.

With billions of ant colonies
across the world's grasslands

all doing exactly the same thing,
that's a mind-boggling amount of grass.

It's estimated that over one third
of the grass that grows on Earth

will be harvested by an insect.

In northern Australia, termites
memorialise their industry in sculpture.

These astonishing mounds
are three metres tall.

They're always built
on a north-south axis,

which is why their builders
are called compass termites.

These castles of clay

protect their builders
from extremes of heat

and seasonal floods
experienced on many grasslands.

Termites manage to do
what most grass eaters can't,

break down dead grass
and extract the nutrients.

But they themselves can be food
for those that can reach them.

A half-metre-long tongue

covered in microscopic hooks,

followed by claws longer
than those of a velociraptor.

A giant anteater
on the plains of South America.

It can devour 20,000 insects a day.

Powerful forelegs enable it to rip apart
a termite hill with ease.

And as the sun bakes the grass,
the termites face new danger.

In minutes, fire turns grassland to ash.

But the grasses are not dead.
Their underground stems are unharmed.

Weeks, months may pass,

but eventually the rains will return
and the grass will sprout again.

Some grasslands must endure
not only fire, but ice.

As winter approaches, the prairies
of North America begin to freeze.

In summer, bison roamed freely,

almost continuously cropping
the abundant green grass.

Now, that grass is not only withered
and frozen, it's about to be buried.

Sixty million tonnes of snow
now blanket this herd's territory.

Pushing through deep snow
is exhausting work,

and the bison are now slowly starving.

just keeping warm
saps huge amounts of energy.

Their thick coats can insulate them
down to minus 30 Celsius.

It's now minus 40.

The only thing that will keep them alive
is buried beneath a metre of snow.

And that's a problem shared
with a surprising neighbour.

The food the fox seeks
is also deep beneath the snow.

The survival of both creatures depends
on getting through to the ground.

For the bison, it will be
a matter of brute strength.

Massive neck muscles enable them
to shovel five tonnes of snow a day.

Their light-weight neighbour
needs more precision.

The bison have reached their goal,

a mouthful of withered grass.

And where the bison have dug,
the fox now spots an opportunity.

Every footstep counts,

but he mustn't break through...

Yet.

He listens carefully
to pinpoint his target.

It's moving.

A vole.

Small, but 100 times more nutritious
than a mouthful of dried grass.

To get through the winter on these
prairies, sometimes brain beats brawn.

Ultimately, life on all grasslands
depends on the turn of the seasons.

Eight hundred kilometres further north
than any tree can survive,

grass returns to life.

Caribou females have
journeyed to the far north

to calve.

Over 70, 000 caribou babies
will be born in the next few days.

As the calves appear, so too do the
leaves of the newly sprouting grass.

And the calves must strengthen quickly.

Within days they will have to
keep up with their parents

on a never-ending march.

At one day old, they're already faster
than an Olympic sprinter.

They're testing the legs that will
carry them thousands of kilometres,

better to learn their limitations now.

It may look playful, but there's
no harder life on the grasslands

than that facing these infants.

The caribou mothers now join together,

each with an infant
exactly the same age.

They're setting off on the greatest
overland trek made by any animal.

But wherever grass eaters travel,
predators lie in wait.

Here they are, Arctic wolves.

They must seize their chance

while the caribou
pass through their territory.

The wolf runs at the herd, trying to
flush out the weak or the slow.

A calf is separated.

At full tilt, 60 kilometres an hour,
the wolf is just faster.

But the calf has stamina.

Only a few weeks old, and this
calf's will to survive is remarkable.

And it needs to be,

for these young caribou
have now started a journey

that will last a lifetime.

Forever chasing the seasonal growth
of the grass on which they depend.

Like all grassland creatures,
they are at the mercy

of these unpredictable
but ultimately bountiful lands.

Grass can survive some of
the harshest conditions on Earth,

flood, fire and frost,
and still flourish.

So it is that grasslands
provide a stage

for the greatest gatherings of wildlife
on planet Earth.

Next time,

we venture to
the newest habitat on Earth,

our cities.

To reveal the extraordinary ways

that animals survive
in this man-made world.
In the last 6, 000 years

the surface of our planet
has undergone a sudden change.

A new habitat has appeared,

entirely designed and constructed
by one species for its own purpose.

This man-made landscape
may seem alien to animal life

but for the bold, this is a world
of surprising opportunity.

Jodhpur, India.

A gang of bachelor male langurs

has come to challenge
the resident alpha male.

This alpha rules over
a valuable urban territory.

But maintaining dominance here
is a constant struggle.

The bachelors have united
to try and overthrow him.

If they win, one of the challengers

will take over
the alpha 's troop of females,

and may kill his infants.

There are 15 males
in this bachelor group.

The alpha must evict every single
one of them from his territory.

He has chased half the bachelors away,

but a splinter group has looped back
and is harassing his females.

Once again, he has to battle.

Finally, he manages to expel them all.

He returns home victorious,

but with a serious wound
on his right leg.

It's a hard life for him in the city.

Keeping the intruders away
is a daily challenge.

But it's worth it.

For these urban territories

are probably the best
langur territories in the world.

They're filled with
rich feeding grounds.

Here in the temple gardens,

the langurs have, over centuries,
developed a surprising relationship.

One that guarantees them
a constantly replenished source of food.

The people here associate langurs
with the Hindu God, Lord Hanuman,

and revere them.

They're given all the food they can eat.

And this high-energy diet
has led to a baby boom.

Female langurs in this city

give birth to twice as many young
as their forest counterparts.

This mother is so well fed
that her rich milk

can support something
rarely seen in the wild.

Twins.

And all these babies can create troops

that are far larger than those
found in the forests nearby.

With less time spent looking for food,
there is more time for play.

The rewards of living in a city
can be huge.

The challenge is to find your niche.

But how to create a home in a world
that wasn't designed for wildlife?

It's far brighter, louder and busier
than anywhere in the natural world.

The continuous traffic creates barriers
to animal movement.

And in this decade,
the urban environment

is predicted to grow by nearly 30%.

What's more, to come here,

animals have to compete
with the world's top predator.

People makes the rules here.

Four billion human beings
now live in the urban environment.

It's here that animals have to contend
with the greatest change

that is happening
to the face our planet.

So why would any animal
want to come here?

New York City.

This densely built-up landscape
is as unnatural as anywhere on Earth.

And yet, this wild peregrine falcon
looks out onto an ideal habitat.

Strange as it may seem,
this vastly-altered landscape

replicates the conditions
in which peregrines evolved.

The towering buildings
have a multitude of ledges

on which falcons can nest,

and the high perches that they need
to catch the wind.

New York City has the highest density

of nesting peregrines
anywhere on the planet.

Winds striking the sides
of the skyscrapers

are deflected upwards
and can help the birds gain height.

And the great areas of concrete
roasting in the sun create thermals,

so that, with very little effort,
the birds can soar over the city.

And so many peregrines can live here,

because down at street level,
there is a lot of potential prey.

Diving from height,
the falcons can reach speeds

of over 500 kilometres an hour.

But their prey stay down low
and close to the buildings.

Too risky.

The peregrine pulls out of his stoop.

But the effort is not wasted.

The falcons need to
flush their prey into the open.

And Manhattan is surrounded by water.

Out here the odds change.

Ana' in the peregrine 's favour.

With abundant prey here all year round,

it has taken only 40 years

for these falcons
to establish themselves here.

And now, among skyscrapers,
they're more successful

than their cousins
living in the wilderness.

Mumbai, in India,
is home to over 20 million people.

And there are predators here

that, though rarely seen,
are rightly feared.

Carnivores,

lured by the prospect
of plentiful unsuspecting prey

are on the prowl.

A leopard.

Every night, under the cover of darkness
they come out to hunt.

These are big animals,

and they're looking for large prey
to satisfy their hunger.

To catch more than a glimpse of them
and reveal their hunting behaviour,

you need night-vision cameras.

Leopards have attacked
almost 200 people here

in the last 25 years.

But humans are not their usual prey.

These leopards are on the hunt
for something else.

Pigs.

These leopards prefer to hunt
the domestic animals

that people have brought to the city
in considerable numbers.

The pigs keep their family close.

The ceaseless noise of the city
plays to their advantage.

It conceals their approach.

And the leopards are using this cover
to hunt all over the city.

This is a thriving population.

In fact, the highest concentration
of leopards in the world

is right here.

It's not only the abundance of food
that attracts wild animals to cities.

They're usually several degrees warmer
than the surrounding countryside.

And here in Rome, in December,

one animal is taking full advantage
of this extra heat.

And it's leaving it's mark.

In a single winter's day,

ten tonnes of its droppings
rain down on the city.

Starlings.

In the evening, they come back
to the warmth of the city

after feeding in
the neighbouring countryside.

They must return
to their roosting trees.

But the first to do so
are at the highest risk

of being caught by birds of prey.

So, they wait for others to arrive.

There's safety in numbers.

As daylight fades, the sky fills
with a staggering one million starlings.

And then follows
one of nature's great spectaculars.

How, or indeed why, they perform
these marvellous aerobatics,

we still do not fully understand.

Eventually, en masse,
they brave the descent

and fill the branches
of their favourite trees.

On these cold winter nights,
the city's extra warmth

can mean the difference
between life and death.

A city, of course, can provide

not only shelter and abundant food,
but glamour.

These varied objects
have been carefully chosen

by a bird for their brightness
and their colour.

This great bowerbird
has spent over a decade

building this collection of
mostly man-made objects.

Out on a golf course
in Townsville, Australia,

he's putting the final touches
to his enormous bower,

that he hopes will impress
a visiting female.

He spends two hours each day
rearranging his prized objects.

"Perhaps that would look
a little better over there."

But it seems that something is missing.

Instead of going into town
to collect new objects,

he's decided to raid
his neighbour's bower.

"A clothes peg! Excellent!"

"And a shiny toy car."

It's a risky game if you get caught.

The owner is back.

There is one bower
where the risk is worth it.

A particular object has caught his eye.

He'll have to wait
for the owner to leave.

This is his chance.

A real treasure.

A scarlet heart.

"Got it. "

The stage is now set
for female visitors.

His luck may be in.

The seduction can now begin.

He's showing off his best goods.

"Perhaps a little plastic piping?

"Or maybe a bit of coloured string?"

But his guest doesn't seem to be
paying much attention.

"A fork?

"Madame?"

Nothing seems to be working.

Something is just not quite right here.

But he still has one trick
up his sleeve.

The scarlet heart.

As a final thrill,
he expands the pink crest

on the back of his head.

The sign of his adulthood.

But he's made a mistake.

This is not a female

but a young male who hasn't yet
developed that head crest.

And he's making off
with the scarlet heart.

It's not easy finding sex in the city.

Raising a family in the city
is not easy either.

It's spring time in Toronto,

and this mother raccoon has exchanged
her native treetops for rooftops.

Since giving birth two months ago,

she's kept her offspring
safe and warm inside a chimney.

Now, her young
have outgrown their nursery.

This is her first major
challenge as a mother.

The time has come to move to a new home.

She needs to get her youngster
to ground level.

But instead of an easy climb
down a tree,

she is faced with a vertical drop,

with little to cling onto.

Her baby's first glimpse
of the urban world,

from a terrifying ten metres up.

This is the last of her litter
to be brought down.

Its siblings are already

- busy exploring the area.

And they have much to learn.

This one has fallen into a back alley
and is trapped.

Mother comes to the rescue
and demonstrates what must be done.

That's the way.

Raccoons are opportunists.

And they're eager to explore.

But they'll have to learn very quickly

how to get along in this
strange new environment

so full of hazards.

Mother comes to the rescue once more.

Urban raccoons are now
demonstrably better

at problem-solving
than their country cousins.

When the feeding opportunities
are this good,

the time spent working out
how to get to it

is well worth it.

The complexity of urban life

favours the clever.

But to compete with humanity
during daylight hours,

takes more than just intelligence.

It takes nerve.

One enterprising species of monkey

has moved into the city
of Jaipur in India.

The Rhesus macaque.

But how to get a share
of all this juicy fruit?

Every morning,
the troop make the same journey

through the urban jungle,
just as human commuters do.

Sometimes, inevitably,
there are traffic jams.

Once they get to the market,
trouble begins.

Being both intelligent and brazen

is the key to beating
human beings on their home turf.

It's daylight robbery.

There are some animals
that most would consider too dangerous

to tolerate in the city.

Spotted hyenas.

They're feared throughout their range.

In the outskirts of Hara in Ethiopia,

two clans are coming face to face
to battle over a prized resource.

There are about 60 hyenas in each clan.

And they're well matched.

After three hours of
posturing back and forth,

the losers retreat

and the victors head
to claim their prize.

They have been fighting
over access to the city.

Once inside the city walls,
they head for one place.

And they know exactly how to get there.

The ancient meat market.

The scent of all these carcasses
lies heavy in the air.

This tradition goes back over 400 years.

The human butchers put out
the bones they don't need

and these hyenas deal with them.

They're the only animals that can.

No other here has such
powerful bone-crushing jaws.

And this relationship
between man and beast

has now been taken a step further.

Yousuf is calling the hyenas
to his house.

He and his forefathers,
going back five generations,

have been feeding the hyenas

by hand.

The inhabitants of this town
believe that hyenas

provide another very important service.

Eating the bad spirits
that haunt the streets.

These are wild and ferocious animals,

but once within these city walls,

they behave in a completely
different way.

Throughout the rest of Africa,
spotted hyenas are feared

because they kill livestock,
sometimes even children.

They are perhaps the most
vilified animal on our planet.

However, here in Harar,

their relationship with people
is entirely peaceful.

They have won the trust of man.

Losing its fear of humans

has enabled one animal
to spread into cities everywhere,

and in huge numbers.

Pigeons are by far
the most successful urban bird.

Here, in Albi, in the south of France,

the pigeons come to the river to bathe.

They need to preen
their flight feathers,

clean off the city dust,

and cool themselves down.

But death lies in wait.

A predator that has taken advantage

of the very thing that has led
to the pigeon's success...

Their lack of fear.

As the pigeons bathe,
oil from their plumage flows downstream,

and is detected.

A monstrous Wels catfish.

Introduced here just 40 years ago,
they have proliferated.

Virtually exterminated
the local fish stocks...

And they've now developed a taste
for pigeon.

Their eyesight is poor,

so they use their barbels to sense
the movements of their victims.

This is a radical new hunting strategy

for what is normally
a bottom-dwelling fish.

After a thousand years
of living in this city,

pigeons are now having to learn
to avoid a fish.

Our cities are always changing.

Sometimes very swiftly.

And animals must cope with the changes,

or disappear.

One of the greatest changes
in recent times

has come from a single invention
made less than 140 years ago.

Electric light.

It has become more and more powerful,

filling our streets with light.

It's everywhere in the city.

It even goes underground.

The difference between day and night
is becoming less and less perceptible.

And that has a profound effect
on the activities of wildlife.

In the wilderness,
light triggers all kinds of behaviour.

On the night of the full moon,

hundreds of tiny
hawksbill turtle hatchlings

emerge from the safety of their nest
deep in the sand.

Their instinct is to reach the sea
as quickly as possible.

And their guide is the light
of the full moon reflected on the water.

But this young hatchling is confused.

It's going in the wrong direction.

Bright light is coming from the land.

And all these hatchlings
are travelling up the beach towards it.

Predators are ready to take advantage.

Crabs now make their burrows
directly beneath the beach lights

and wait for their prey to come to them.

Even if a hatchling escapes,

they're still in peril.

The lights become
more and more bewildering.

80% of all hatchlings on this beach are now disorientated by the lights of the town. Roads bring many to their end. Hundreds get trapped in storm drains every night. Exhausted by the effort of travelling such a distance on land, this hatchling's chances of surviving the night are slim. This turtle is one of the countless species that have been unable to adapt to the change brought about by the urban environment. Only a small number of animals have managed to find ways of living alongside us. And every ten years, an area the size of Britain disappears under a jungle of concrete. But it doesn't have to be like this. Could it not be possible to build cities more in harmony with nature? How, and whether we decide to invite the wildlife back, is up to us. This tree is rising nearly 50 storeys. It's one of almost 800 being planted to create a vertical forest in Milan. This number of living trees would normally fill two hectares of woodland, but here, they occupy one-tenth of that area. Greening the walls and roofs of our buildings could create a rich and extensive habitat, if we wanted it to do so. There is one city where that idea is being applied on a major scale. Singapore. Two million trees have been planted here in the last 45 years. This city is now richer in species than any other in the world. And this practice extends to all parts of the city. The waterways have been cleaned up, and smooth-coated otters are coming back. But perhaps the most spectacular example of city greening is this grove of super trees. These 50-metre high metal structures are now full of life. Creepers have been planted to grow over the outermost branches. Is this a vision of our cities of the future? The potential to see animals thriving within our cities is achievable across the globe. More than half of us now live in an urban environment. Whether we choose to create a home for others too is up to us.
